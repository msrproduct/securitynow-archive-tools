 Netcast you love from people you trust this is great bandwidth for security now is provided
 by AOL radio at AOL.com/podcasting this is security now with Steve Gibson
 episode 96 for June 14 2007 your questions Steve's answers number 20
 security now is brought to you by Astaro makers of the Astaro security gateway on
 the web at www.ast a r o dot com and by nerds on site looking to grow your IT
 service business find out how nerds on site can help visit I want to be a nerd
 dot com it's time to talk security with our friend Steve Gibson from his secure
 highly secure and unknown workplace somewhere in Southern California tempest
 protected here he is Steve Gibson hello Steve hey Leah great to be back with you
 again and this is a question and answer session and we do this is our 20th
 our 20th question and answer session and people really I get lots of good
 feedback from people in fact now they're writing notes in saying okay this is
 for and they're like telling me which one they want to appear on it's like okay
 it doesn't quite work like that however I bet there are few people who want to
 appear on the next one we do which will be episode 100 oh yes yeah that's right
 that's a Q&A yeah is a hundred evenly divisible by four not if it's a leap
 year I think it is yeah we're gonna do that in a second I want to do want to
 thank the folks at a star because they are our longtime sponsors over a year
 now they are a great security company one of the best known and one of the
 things I really like about a star is they're based on open source they're
 based on Linux they use the best of breed and open source and a commercial
 software so you get a really great solution take a look at version 7 you get
 all sorts of new features there's web filtering for content antivirus anti
 spyware instant messenger and peer-to-peer control you get network
 protection like firewalls of course remote access VPN and intrusion
 protection you're protected against spam and phishing there's dual virus
 protection for email transparent encryption at the source I mean it goes
 on and on and all of this in one little box looks about looks like a router but
 boy it's sure a heck of a lot more than a router you want to find out more you
 can get an a star security gateway for a free trial in your business just call
 eight seven seven the number four a st a ro and the new version seven has a new
 home use package free of charge including the base license and all
 subscriptions plus a star up to date absolutely free absolutely free there
 are some limitations ten IPs a thousand concurrent connections that should be
 enough for you so basically you don't have to purchase the home user
 subscription bundle anymore for 79 euros they're giving it away these are good
 people making a great product that really does the job that's why so many
 people trust a star that's why we trust a star I would encourage you to use them
 AST ARO dot com or call eight seven seven the number four a star
 shall I just what what a thousand concurrent connections on the whole
 that seems like that should be enough I don't think I don't have that many on
 GRC server no isn't that fun there that's what I love about these guys I mean
 they're just you know they're not they're not trying to take take anybody anybody's
 money I mean it's just it's just really great but I do encourage you to buy the
 product because you have to for commercial use and it really is great I
 guess having all those home users really gives you a good test bed too you know
 anyway let's let's get on here I've got a PDF open that contains a couple a
 couple mailbag oh oh good all right I didn't even know we did mail bags on a
 Q&A days I thought we're already answering questions but we have a mail
 bag we might as well do it's quick it's just too it's just two things just an
 Alcorn of Cleveland Heights Ohio writes he had a number of neat points he said
 a couple of quick comments on your fourth factor episode first I'm glad
 you're covering these authentication issues too many people assume that a
 username and a password is to factor authentication including a government
 agency that lost a laptop and assured the public that it was secure because it
 was protected by two factor authentication man yeah meaning the
 meaning the normal Windows log on oh man I hope that was not disinformation I
 hope that was just ignorance or maybe not actually which is worse it certainly
 sounded good then he then he says there is a wonderful add-on for Firefox
 called password maker it allows you to use a single password and it hashes your
 password and the domain name of the site you are currently on yeah to create a
 unique random looking password for each site since the hash is created the same
 way every day every time you can get your password from any computer with the
 browser or use the online JavaScript version if you are on a different
 computer I use something similar from Zarate Labs same exact idea yep and I
 like it and for what it's worth there is also an add-on for IE they don't have
 screenshots of it they've got screenshots of the Firefox version on
 on password maker but I just wanted to I thought that was a cool thing and I've
 heard about it so I wanted to relay that from from Justin our listener that's a
 good way to do it and then he says when talking about the PGP web of trust there
 are two things you didn't mention actually there's a lot of things I didn't
 mention because I was trying to keep it somewhat simple and and you know
 maintainable he says you can choose how much you trust each signatory of a
 certificate if you know people who just sign anything presented to them you can
 trust them only a little if you know people who are very careful you can trust
 them a lot then you can sum up the trusts of people who signed a given
 certificate I added that part of for clarity to determine if you trust the
 certificate of a new contact also when determining whether to sign someone's
 key you should verify the key fingerprint to make sure you're signing
 the correct key and not one that was presented to you by a man in the middle
 and of course he's absolutely correct about all of that so you know there was
 more complexity a lot more actually to the whole mature implementation of the
 PGP web of trust specifically this notion that you you get different sort of
 point credits for who signed it and how much you trust them you then can like
 create rules in your system that'll automatically decide whether this is
 trustworthy enough or not right right right and then Christopher Adams also a
 security now listener he wrote we have Albuquerque's largest Christian home
 school association meeting next week at the church I work for and right on cue
 the laptop that contains all the data for this event crashed he says the
 backtop was stored in the North Pole with Santa where the Easter money and the
 keeper elves are keeping it company what he's saying is there's no backup we or
 either that or when we went to look for it we couldn't find it oh boy so he says
 now there were no problems with the hard drive just a problem with the power
 adapter so we simply needed the data quickly so we could move on with our work
 I pop the drive into a USB enclosure and sure enough the drive failed and so he
 says parens I guess having the power abruptly cut on a regular basis was not
 good for the laptop drive and actually I chose this one because this fee that
 this actually perfectly fits with one of the questions in the Q&A so he says
 after fighting through numerous error performing in-page operation errors and
 learning that the solution was to buy a new hard drive I quickly put the hard
 drive in a lap in a desktop case via a nifty five dollar adapter along with a
 CD containing spin right four and a half hours later the service of the 60 gig
 laptop drive had been refreshed and it now worked perfectly wow he said I've been
 anxiously awaiting a moment like this where spin right paid for itself and I'm
 happy to say it was worth every penny wow and we bought four copies for a site
 license exclamation point that's great so he had actually written this to sales
 and so he said at GRC and he said thanks everyone I cannot describe how much this
 has helped us and it is a great case study for when I propose a file server
 with RAID and a backup system instead of relying on individual hard drives that's
 what I like about you Steve you don't mind reminding people that they wouldn't
 need spin right if they would just back their stuff up yeah I mean I'm I'm happy
 to be you know the the solution that saved them the one time they desperately
 needed it and to suggest you know you know I hope to be able to help them a
 second and a third and a fourth time and of course we've got owners whose spin
 right who who's whose butts have been saved by spin right throughout no it's
 it's 20 year life but it really for mission critical stuff you don't want to
 rely on a single spindle because they're as we continually prove they're just not
 safe enough spindles die let us let us get to our questions shall we we have
 so many of them are our typical 12 our typical 12 starting with Mark Brown of
 coming Georgia who says I listened to episode 90 that was the one we did on
 multi-factor authentication the first three factors and I wanted to know how
 to check for the certificate when I'm going to my banking site to make sure
 I'm really on the correct site so he's in his browser he's gone it was banking
 site how does he know yep now we've talked about this many times but I don't
 think this is something I could say often enough because I'll tell you Lee I
 mean you know me I'm I'm not running AV I'm I'm behind that I'm I don't do
 scripting my guess my point is you know I'm security conscious but I feel that
 I'm I'm generally pretty safe well having said that one of the things I
 always do when I'm find myself about to enter my credit card information
 somewhere is I first make sure I've got HTTPS and that the browser thinks I'm
 secure then I right click on the page choose properties and then choose view
 certificate to make sure that you know that I mean just to verify that no new
 phishing scheme has come along which is spoofing this page and I always do
 this on PayPal because of course the larger the target is the more likely it
 is to be spoofed and so I make sure that this certificate is that I'm viewing
 for the site is HTTPS call and slash slash www.paypal.com so you want to right
 click on the page then tell the browsers you know look at the page
 properties then click on view certificate to see the certificate then the one other
 thing you want to do is look at the at the chain of trust that is look to see
 who signed that certificate because if it's Boris Badenoff that signed it then
 the certificate means nothing the certificate is only as as useful as the
 entity that is vouching for it specifically you know someone like Equifax
 or or or Verosene or or or somebody who is a standard signing authority if your
 own for example if your corporate if you're if you had a browser had a corporate
 certificate installed in it then your corporate proxy could be decrypting
 your connection looking at it and then re-encrypting it and so that's
 something you might want to know so you want to make sure that that your
 certificate has been that is the certificate of the of the site you're
 presented with has been signed by an authority you trust and that you've got
 a certificate for that site and that will verify you're actually connected to
 where you think you are now it's a little different slightly but not
 significantly different in Firefox you still right click you see and by the way
 that you have to be at HTTPS right and otherwise there won't be a certificate
 correct so you're so I went to Amazon.com normally it's HTTP I added the S now
 I'm at HTTPS Amazon.com I right click on the page and am in Firefox select page
 info and then click the security tab and you can view the certificate from there
 and it's it's a RSA data security are they okay I think we trust them we trust
 them and we trust them that's where you get yours from right or is it Verisine I
 I've always been using Verisine it's like yeah why not I'll stay with them yeah
 very good question though and I think it is well worth saying again and again
 Paul Dixon of Phoenix Arizona is concerned about biometrics he writes I'm
 of the opinion that gathering biometric data for identification purposes should
 be illegal it's fine you have the data on your notebook locked with your
 fingerprint but can you or your estate survive if the data becomes inaccessible
 if you're in an accident where you lose a body part are you prepared to not being
 able to access the disk contents of course backup would help but what about
 changes since the backup disk recovery is going to be extremely costly
 alternatively if you're separate from your notebook no one would be able to
 access your data until you're rejoined not even trusted family can we help can
 help I've been told by someone who no longer has fingerprints it's quite
 common for nurses to lose their fingerprints the fingerprint scanner
 might must be the caustic chemicals are using a fingerprint scanner that might
 not be very useful for them then there's a problem whether to replace a replaced
 fingerprint scanner your notebook will scan your finger in the same manner see
 raises some interesting questions I'm not sure you're making it illegal is that's
 if that's the going a little far but he's well yeah it makes a good points he
 really does now so I wanted to bring it brings up a couple things first of all
 for what it's worth the fingerprint scan for example that I use for my
 laptop is a convenience measure if I'm unable to authenticate with my
 fingerprint I can always fall back to a password doesn't eliminate the password
 exactly so so it's so it's basically the if my fingerprint matches what it
 expects then it's providing the password to the BIOS in order to unlock the
 machine and to unlock the hard drive and on this note I wanted to mention that
 when I was doing some research into this stuff a couple weeks ago I discovered
 Hitachi has announced and will soon if not already they are shipping the I mean
 the galactic perfect solution for laptop hard drive it has bulk AES 256
 encryption built-in to the hard drive so that it's not just locking the hard
 drive you have to give the hard drive anytime you power it on a the the
 cryptographic key that it will then use for all communication with the magnetic
 surface which which means I mean this is what you want which means that that
 all the data on the hard drive is always encrypted not just locked by a lock in
 the hard drives own BIOS where you could have a data recovery company get past
 that and then access I mean we're talking strengths that is that is
 absolutely transparent they're doing bulk encryption that does not slow down
 the drive at all that is it's on the fly encryption to the surface I'm I mean
 this is exactly what you want then if you lose control of your laptop it's like
 well that's too bad but at least nobody can get to the data but what about
 Paul's point where that nobody can get to the data what if something happens to
 you and your family needs to see the data well for example in the first place
 you know when for example I authenticated a number of my fingers just in case if
 something did happen to my right to my right hand I can authenticate with the
 other and being me you know I sort of alternate consciously just to make sure
 that both of my my index fingers stay you know it stay happy but again in the
 worst case I've got a password I don't want to because I as you know I've got a
 super strong password so I'm not gonna be typing that in easily all the time and
 in fact because my fingerprint can help me type in my super strong password I
 was able to use a much stronger password than I would normally have
 bothered to so I mean and again you know you could certainly you know you could
 answer Paul's Paul's concern just by knowing that you always have the password
 as your backstop for your fingerprint I think you didn't know that so that's
 good to know I didn't know that yep and that was the point I wanted to make that
 and the friend to remind or I forgot to mention this Hitachi drive and I've been
 wanting to because oh baby I mean that'll be that'll end up being standard
 equipment on laptop drives before long and it really provides us with the
 security that we need yeah interesting John Everett writes from Virginia I just
 finished listening to your sequel injection security now podcast when you
 get to the part about how a hacker could get an improperly configured machine to
 divulge a list of all usernames and associated passwords I had to write and
 ask do people really stand up production websites that record passwords and
 plain text uh-huh I'm no security expert but I thought the days of a password
 file he's this is these are the Unix passwords PASWD file or equivalent we're
 long gone isn't it standard practice now to hash the password plus some salt
 into a key that's stored they call these encrypted password ashes so even if a
 hacker got a list of usernames in the keys that wouldn't be of immediate use
 because you can't enter the key directly into the website maybe you were glossing
 over this aspect in the podcast any any case I hardly agree with you
 sequel injection remains a frightening vulnerability on the web you were
 giving that as an example it's not the only thing you can do with sequel
 injection well correct but he's he's the point I wanted to make the reason I
 brought this up was that that the insecurity is not only in the SQL
 injection problem but in exactly what he says that is to say a a what when he
 talks about there are well known ways to do this right he's absolutely correct
 it doesn't mean that you know random Joe PHP programmer who just bought PHP for
 dummies and and it turns out that book is unfortunately correctly named in his
 case absolutely name it doesn't it doesn't mean he's gonna do it right
 because he's the coder he can do anything he wants he can store them in a text
 file and and and and look them up you know have they have the passwords in
 plain text and so it's in and this is the the message that I that I want to
 remind people of it is incumbent upon the developer to implement security the
 nature of web 2-0 stuff is that this is a responsibility of the developer and you
 know there are no there are no requirements nothing in the language
 suggests it if you have a developer who isn't aware of storing hashed passwords
 and then comparing the hashes rather than the passwords which does create
 exactly the enhanced security that John's talking about you have a programmer who
 just doesn't know about that then you're not gonna have it so yes it's just one
 more area of insecurity right Thomas Brock of Santa Monica wonders as both a
 longtime spin right user and employee of a large computer security company I
 really enjoy listening to you and Leo I have used and developed for Windows
 machines since Windows 2 386 edition I purchased my first Mac about a year ago
 I really like it one thing I've never wrapped my head around though is the
 keychain every time I get a something wants to access your blah blah key chain
 I always click a lot because I don't know what's going on could you please
 explain the Mac OS 10 keychain and Leo this one is for you thanks no warning
 well I think keychain is actually one of the nicest features of OS 10 it is a
 secure store of your passwords when you use Safari on the web it stores the
 passwords in this secure store the store is unlocked by default when you log
 in if the keychain has the same password credential that you use when you log in
 it will automatically unlock the keychain so so that's nice you can change the
 keychain password or conversely change your master login password to your
 account and then you'll have to provide a separate login to open up the keychain
 always what he's talking about is a second layer of security with I think is a
 very valuable layer of security when you change a program a program hasn't been
 used before with keychain when you update the program or reinstall it the
 first time it tries to access the keychain and this is one of the reasons the
 Mac is more secure the Mac says this program wants to access the keychain is
 it okay to do so so just as with all of these alerts windows - with the UAC you've
 got to pause when you see that message and say hmm why is the keychain being
 accessed who's doing it yep it doesn't make sense so for if you if you if you
 if by the way most Mac programs do use keychain any program that has a password
 for instance like Safari will use keychain so here's here's kind of what
 happens you you updated Safari using you know the Apple update and you use it
 the first time you launch Safari it says Safari wants to access the keychain is
 this okay now you think well I just updated Safari I use Safari Safari use
 keychain yeah okay go ahead and I think that's the that's the point on all of
 these you these alerts is you've got to think about who's asking for permission
 yep in fact it's funny you know you and I were talking before we began
 recording that I just updated my Skype from 2.0 something or other to 2.6
 something or other and sure enough I got exactly this dialogue saying hey Skype
 wants to access the keychain do you want to you know give it permission to do so
 now and in the future and it's like okay yep I know why it's asking so let's go
 ahead and you can safely say no in which case Skype won't provide your
 password for you automatically right so I think in you know this is actually kind
 of a response to your previous question Apple has I think done passwords right
 they don't in store passwords in clear text on the drive they store it in a
 secured store that is highly secure using strong encryption and that's what
 this keychain facility is and it's a very useful facility there's a lot of
 features in there people don't know about it will generate secure passwords for
 you automatically automatically store them it's it's like a password utility
 the kind you'd go out and buy but it's built into OS 10 I think keychain is is
 really cool where you get into trouble is when you've changed your password
 on your master login or you move a keychain from one system to another then
 people get annoyed by it because it keeps asking for a password you can also
 change the default behavior normally keychain will stay logged in the entire
 time you're logged into your system you can change that you could say after 30
 minutes ask again oh very nice probably not a bad idea to do that well and you
 know clearly that the OS 10 also has a keychain API that the applications are
 aware of and are able to access and Windows has nothing like that if you know
 I think this is a great idea if you open the it's in the utility applications
 utility folder keychain access you can see all the programs that use keychain
 and what they're storing in there very nice and that's where you would also
 change your your preferences and they have a first aid and so forth you can
 clear the log you can synchronize the login password there's a lot of key
 keychain settings you can change as well I think I think this is really great it
 uses certificates it's it uses standards this is an example of where Apple has
 done things right and as a result this is one of the things I think that makes OS
 10 more secure well I would say that Thomas Brock got a beautiful answer to his
 question well good I made it up as I was going on Bob G of Auburn Alabama is
 worried about the health of his DVR in Q&A 19 you talked about how the drive
 in a Tivo constantly spins more than that it constantly writes exactly it's
 constantly recording yeah the DVR that Charter Cable uses is a moxie box DVR
 works similarly to a Tivo it would have to if it has the ability to pause live
 programming that's how it does it during the podcast you said something about how
 a user should be careful when turning off a DVR to reduce the impact on the
 drive because we have short power outages of 15 to 20 seconds in my area oh
 that's nice yeah I've gotten UPS's for my desktop PCs and network equipment should
 I get one for the DVR I asked when I was installed it was told no well of
 course he was told no because you know people look at it and think of it as just
 sort of a consumer appliance right and and I just so I put this in here when I
 ran across Bob's question because you know I'm and I've even defended it once
 because I think we had another listener who said I really don't think it's
 it's recording all the time right well we've we demonstrated that it must be
 because it's storing 30 minutes and the Tivo or and other DVRs don't have nearly
 that much RAM so it's got to be recording it on the hard drive let me I just want
 to point something out because I think this is really important there it is
 perfectly possible to hear a question like that say well let me find out and go
 research it but I like how you work you you use logic you thought about it and
 this is I think what distinguishes somebody like you from a rote
 computer expert you understand kind of the rationality of this and you're able
 to think about it and quite quickly say oh no there's no way it could because
 this is how it would have to work and I like that I mean we could verify it and
 I know it's true because it's it's completely logical yep so he does want a
 I mean if he's concerned about this a UPS makes a lot of sense I know the these
 devices can survive obviously some power outages because there's no on-off switch
 on them you you plug them in and they're just on and just like a cable box is
 pretty much on all the time in fact even when you turn your cable box off it's
 still showing you the time of day and it's on inside it's waiting you know good
 because we know when you plug them in they take about you know five minutes to
 boot themselves up and loading their their code from the you know over the
 cable so so these things are going all the time and we do know that if you
 suddenly power down a hard drive when it's in the middle of writing it will
 destroy the sector or sectors that it's on top of and you know that's gonna give
 a little a little road bump at that point when when it comes around now they're
 built to be tolerant of that but over time these this adds up so I would say
 give yourself a UPS and maybe after you put it on a UPS if you can often these
 cable boxes have all kinds of security funky you know triangular headed screws
 and things but of course I've opened mine up and modified them extensively if
 you can take the drive out and well unfortunately I don't mean didn't mean
 this to be a spin right commercial but I don't know of anything else other than
 spin right that would do the right thing and that is run it on spin right may
 maybe Bob already owns a copy spin right in which case definitely run it on
 spin right to clean the drive up after you put your DVR on a UPS and you'll be
 in good shape from there on you know thinking thinking about this I would
 imagine that and I don't know for a fact that the DVRs would use a journaled
 file system they don't in fact I can only speak for the Tivo because I know
 Tivo cold and it isn't a standard EX T2 using riser or something huh yep
 Linux file system it isn't and it's an old version an old kernel of Linux and
 a small one that's not a big fancy one I remember now exe3 and riser and other
 file systems are journaled always 10 is journaled and TFS is journaled let this
 is a bonus question doesn't that give you a little bit more reliability in
 cases like this kind of what the what the the problem is all of these systems are
 trying to be error tolerant but they're relying on the drive to be the sole
 store of of their state what NTFS system for example guarantees is that the the
 way it writes the file system it's that the file system structure will be
 maintained but not the data and nothing can solve the problem that when you pull
 the plug and power fails during writing the sector that that sector cannot have
 a proper checksum at the end so it's good and there may be some power glitch
 happening so it the system is not going to be happy about it when it
 re encounters that again and so so NTFS in fact this is something people don't
 understand NTFS protects its structure but not the user's data that's not
 protected right so a journal system writes the data out in a batch is that
 what it means to be journaled yes and the idea being that it's it's creating a
 journal of changes so that if something happens it's able to roll back to a to
 a point where the system was in the hard drive and file system were in a
 consistent state ah and and it may then be able to roll forward from the journal
 given if it's if the journal is also being written to the hard drive it can
 roll forward to recreate the transactions which may have been damaged
 during the the problem that it that occurred while it was journaling so it's
 more robust but not impervious to problem well and and again nothing can
 solve the problem that power failure failure during a sector right will make
 a bad sector absolutely will and then when the system encounters it again the
 question is what does it do right and that happens to be that's one of the
 things that's been right fixes it it like fixes all the checksums on all the
 sectors on your drive trusting now of course when you're playing back stuff on
 a DVR a bad sector here there just means a glitch in the video it's not the end of
 the world it's not but of course either they're cumulative and here in in in
 Auburn Alabama where Bob says he gets out out of just constantly you know it
 will add up and I'll be I believe he'll end up seeing some problems on the other
 hand you can just tell this cable company hey this thing went bad give me
 another one he's only written it exactly yeah Lars Solberg listens in Norway he's
 been comparing podcast advice he's a bit confused by some apparent discrepancies
 well we're always right so I'm just gonna say that right now I'm alone well what
 in doubt yeah I'm a longtime listener of the security now podcast I also listen
 to a bunch of other podcasts one of them started talking about data backup and
 how long time archival data can be safe on a hard drive that was turned off just
 sitting in the closet or a safe so I thought well I already know this Mr. Gibson
 already told me right but they said on one of Norwegians biggest IT podcasts
 that a hard disk drive is gonna live longer if you keep the power on then if
 you use it as a backup solution I clearly remember you and Leo talked about this
 but I've been searching and reading through the text versions I can't find it
 have I been dreaming can you clarify how long will a powered off hard drive live
 that's a great question and I think what's happened is Lars got a little
 tripped up in some detail of what we're talking about which is why I thought
 this was a great question because Leo I actually get a huge number of people
 wanting to talk about backup solutions and it's something I've been avoiding
 because we're security now and I don't want to be you know too much pandering to
 you know spin right and backup stuff but at some point we're gonna have to do a
 show on hard drive backup solutions because it's a it's a question that we're
 getting all the time in this case the danger that a hard drive has well okay
 first I should say we're both right the the major Norwegian biggest IT podcast is
 right and we were right because what we neither of us we're talking about is
 power cycling that's the danger for hard drives is turning them off and on and
 off and on and off and on I work to minimize the power cycling on all of my
 computers where if I know for example that I'm not going to be using a computer
 for several days then I'll turn it off but I will never turn a machine off if I
 know that I'm gonna be back on it in another hour because it's the it's the
 thermal heating and cooling heating and cooling power on power off power on
 power off that's the problem so I presume the the guys who did the
 Norwegian podcast we're talking about keeping a drive running all the time
 being better than powering it on and off that's absolutely true I was talking
 about putting the drive on the shelf which obviously keeps it powered off all
 the time and that's better than powering it on and off so either extreme all the
 time running like you know the drives at level three on GRC servers are on all
 the time or all the time off much better than power cycling constantly the heating
 and cooling is bad for it really is now if you I know a lot of people do this in
 fact a lot of video production facilities because hard drives are cheap and big
 we'll just put data on them they'll wrap them up and bubble wrap and throw them
 in the closet do you have to worry about things like
 Stiction bearings kind of getting gooey things like that if they're not used for
 a long period of time well decades maybe I mean but you know I mean for really
 really good archival storage all the studies show that hard drives will last
 a long time but also recordable DVD recordable media there there's I
 fact I bought a bunch the other day it was it was an archive grade DVD that is
 a goal it's you know gold gold it will only record at 1x it won't let itself be
 recorded any faster than that and it is it is built for 100 year storage and you
 know made very stable so so certainly decades I think are safe I've got
 old original version one IDE drives that I use for testing new versions of
 Spinrite and I don't and I don't dust them off very often but they still fire
 up when I when I use them so problems like Stiction I think have been
 largely solved and taking a drive and just putting it on a shelf for many many
 years is the best thing you can do for it it'll it'll still be there when you
 plug it in again as long as you still have an interface that's compatible with
 exactly I think really the truth is in back in the case of backup no backup
 lasts forever and and and as you point out no medium will always be readable so
 probably the prudent thing to do if you do have something you want to keep a
 hundred years is every decade or even more often you want to copy it to a more
 modern medium yet because it for example try to find an SD controller yeah yeah
 you know you can't do something that didn't last very long with that still try
 to find a SCSI controller these days right I mean it doesn't take long you got
 some stuff on zip discs good luck uh-huh orb good luck I mean that's the
 problem with this stuff is it changes a decade is probably even too long maybe
 every every five years then you refresh the data you make sure it's good you put
 on something that's more modern that you can read and I would guess that as time
 goes by these archival solutions get better and better and of course the
 point is if this stuff if this data is really that important then you do need
 to be aware of it and to give it the attention it deserves it if it's that
 important most stuff isn't I can't not much of what I do would is worth saving
 a hundred years you know and I've got I have original I have drives from that
 I've pulled from old machines carefully labeled you know here's in 1980 once I
 know my C drive it's like you know yeah maybe maybe a walk down nostalgia lane
 would be you know interesting yeah when you're really it's clearly nothing I
 need on that drive your MS dot MS does dot sys file you're well remember the
 days when we actually knew what all those files were Leo
 yeah wow look at that it's an auto exec dot bad file Bruce in Gilbert
 Arizona worries about sticky fingers he says Steve I have a question on the
 security of a fingerprint scanner on a laptop you state it's all you use to
 protect your laptop for login and to decrypt your drive or to boot up I've
 read that these scanners are pretty easy to fool with a copy of a person's
 fingerprint somebody somebody did a test and you could make it out of Play-Doh and
 it worked pretty well I've read that these scanners oh I we just said that
 would it be easy to get the person's fingerprint from a lost or stolen
 laptop merely by dusting it for prints sounds like a CSI episode your
 fingerprints would be all over from handling it you can also tell which
 finger is which by the prints left on the keyboard home keys if that made any
 difference yeah interesting idea what do you
 think Steve there are two classes a fingerprint scanner the the scanners
 which have a a large rectangular array where you push your fingerprint against
 it are inherently insecure for exactly that reason you you can get a you know
 make a Xerox from a static Xerox copy from an image and push that on the
 scanner and it'll go wow this guy's got a high contrast thumb but it'll work
 what what what I like the only fingerprint scanners I trust are the
 dynamic ones not static where they have either a two or four pixel high optical
 array and actually they're not even optical they're actually capacitive the
 fingerprint yes the fingerprint scanners that you see now on laptops that are
 that little strip just a bar yeah yeah the little bar that you wipe your
 finger across they're not optical they're capacitive they work on the same
 principle as those studfinders where where you know though those yellow
 studfinders you scan them across the wall and it's able to tell when the
 density behind the wall increases those are that uses a capacitive technology
 which is the same thing that that these that these dynamic fingerprint scanners
 use so for example you could not swipe a Xerox of the image over the scanner you
 actually have to have a 3D creation of the fingerprint so not only does it have
 to be 3D but it's got to be dynamic you got to move it across this scanner and
 so using this several pixels worth of of of I'm sorry keep saying pixel well I
 guess they are pixels they're they're not optical scanner pixels they're
 capacitive scanner pixels so using using that strip it's able to track the
 motion seeing the image move from one row to the next so it knows how far and
 how fast your finger is moving but it's not using light it's using the
 differences in capacitive reactants in your finger which is much harder to fool
 so not only dynamic but capacitive and that's a pretty secure way to pick up a
 fingerprint fascinating Alex Banks writing from Los Angeles asks back in
 episode 68 68 wow Q&A a listener want to know about dual quad core Intel
 processors you and Leo commented this is probably overkill and that dual dual
 cores are sufficient what about heavy VM applications when the these are the
 virtual machines we talk so much about things like parallels and VMware with
 the additional processing power greatly enhanced VM performance well there this
 is an interesting question from a couple points first of all the big load in VM
 is RAM because virtual machines essentially have to just take a chunk of
 RAM out of this out of the hosting system and commit it to their own OS that is
 when you're running for example parallels on a Mac and you're running
 Windows there isn't a practical means for Windows to share the main system
 memory in its virtual machine with the hosts memory it has to have all whatever
 it is hundred I'm sorry 512 megs or a gig or whatever so heavy VM uses that is
 where you got multiple VMs they're all going to be grabbing a static chunk of
 memory from the main system so really memory is the problem there now having
 said that of course the more processors you have the better except that what you
 quickly run into is resource starvation in other places than processing power for
 example you can end up where as I said you don't have enough memory or you just
 can't get you can't get enough access to the hard drive right because you've got
 processors that are doing so much that suddenly they're not the bottleneck so
 you know as in any any examination of a system it's always the weakest link or
 the biggest bottleneck that causes the problem I mean that's I owe I mean
 frequently that's I owe yes that's exactly the the direction I was going to
 go in this when I when we were being DDoSed being hit with not distributed
 denial of service attacks you know six or seven years ago I did some some study
 of what it would take to build a system that could respond to that and it turned
 out that the PCI bus was instantly bottleneck that is I couldn't get no
 matter what fast code I wrote in the processor no matter how fast the
 processor was or how many of them I had I could not get a useful amount of band
 width across the PCI bus to the network adapter the PCI bus was the problem so
 so again it's at some point you just end up with too much engine and not enough
 wheel I like that I love that in fact that you're you used to drive so you know
 what that means too much engine is not a wheel I don't know what it means but I
 like it you see I have to say I have a quad core Mac Pro run parallels all the
 time runs swiftly beautifully and I don't think having an eight core which is
 what he's talking about the the quad quad the dual quads I don't know if an
 eight core would make much of a difference frankly I built a machine not
 long ago that I think I referred to here I did get a myself a quad core Pentium and
 boy is it fast for compressing for compressing media yeah oh my goodness I
 mean it is it will spoil you in a heartbeat where I mean as long as you've
 got a media compression technology that understands multiple cores and multiple
 threads I mean it's just shocking how fast it is because there you are
 massively compute bound of course now I'm going to get a call from the city at
 home guys who are going to say we come on get your screen saver going Gibson we
 want to use those quad cores on to to find the aliens well that's what they
 found with with the PlayStation 3s which have these new cell processors and
 effectively I think they have eight or nine cores they really do very well with
 these distributed Apple computing applications hey they they rack up CPU
 cycles fast well in fact I've been messing around with avid liquid 7 doing
 some some DVD production from my homeowners association and many of the
 special effects systems that software itself requires that you use a you know
 a powerful video card because what they're doing is they're now offloading a
 lot of this work into the GPU the graphics processing unit because these
 these are our graphic systems have become so powerful now yeah and I run all the
 time a little CPU meter in my menu it's a Mac program called menu meters and I
 rarely I have to say peg it but it is when you do things like rendering you
 know transcoding video things like that where it really is processor intensive
 right it's hard though to get for processors pegged I have to say for two
 point something gigahertz processors that's a lot a lot of processing power
 yeah continuing on Mike in Long Island has been experiencing email grief my ISP
 provides email via pop an SMTP as most do however they've caused much grief of
 late due to much grief due to the following situation the email addresses
 that my wife and I present to the world are in the form of my first name at last
 name dot net this domain is owned and maintained by my brother for various
 members of our extended family as well as some of his customers however he's not
 in a position to provide storage merely forwarding mail that goes to that
 addresses then forwarded to the real address given to me by my ISP problem is
 my ISP seems to have some sort of anti spam policy in place and appears to be
 bouncing some emails that are referred through this family domain yep yeah
 I'm very curious because I do the same thing evidently some sort of hamfist
 attempt to protect me well it's not hamfist it's you're gonna see more and
 more of it actually uh-huh we're still they refuse to admit they're even doing
 so making it impossible for me to convince them to whitelist this domain
 I'm considering signing up with an email hosting service like fast mail and
 referring my emails there in the hopes of better results can you recommend any
 other courses of action what's going on Steve well it's exactly as you said Leo
 it is it is ISPs finally beginning to to do what they can to minimize email
 you know abuse in the form of spam he the the problem is there is no good
 solution for him except to use a an ISP that would be friendly to the idea of
 receiving this relayed mail we've talked about before they the the SPF
 framework where which is becoming increasingly popular or even Yahoo uses
 domain keys I think Google is able to use both the idea being that
 that you authenticate the server as the source of your email so so the problem
 is this guy is trying to send email from his ISP that has a different domain than
 the ISP for example if if I were Steve at Cox.net and I would be using Cox's
 SMTP server to deposit my mail it would then connect to another server somewhere
 then say hi I'm I'm this I'm SMTP dot Cox.net with mail from Steve at Cox.net
 well due to this new anti-spam and the spam approach the remote server would
 say I really want to make sure that you're a qualified sender for email from
 Cox.net and and Cox would say yes you know I know that's what I'm doing I'm
 gonna stand behind any Cox.net email now what Mike in Long Island is doing is
 he's sending email from you know through Cox's server so now when his email tries
 to go somewhere else that somewhere else is saying wait a minute is this a
 valid source of mail now the good news is I don't know what what his brother
 who's who's providing this forwarding service what capabilities his brother
 has but potentially if is if if this were a problem with SPF SPF is a DNS
 based authentication system if his brother has control of the DNS for this
 hypothetical domain last name.net his brother could put an SPF record add a
 tech an SPF text record to the last name.net domain authorizing Cox.net as a
 valid emitter of email for the last name.net domain so it's very possible that
 this problem could get solved by essentially at the last name.net domain
 adding some SPF records to allow essentially to permit Cox to be a sender
 of this guy's email. Microsoft has a wizard that will create this SPF record
 that you add to your DNS so if you want to know more about that do a Google
 search for sender ID framework record wizard and on Microsoft.com and you can
 fill it out and then it gives you this little snippet and you just drop it in
 your DNS yeah of course you have to have access to the DNS to do this right and
 so and and this was I was never quite understood this by the way Microsoft
 describes this and actually has diagrams and stuff at Microsoft.com /
 sender ID I never understood this so which end does it do both ends need this
 modified SPF record it's the sender end that needs somebody to represent that
 that it's a valid sender so for example when when email is trying to go to a
 remote server the remote server sees first name at last name.net yeah the
 remote server then asks for the text records of last name.net yeah to find
 out who last name.net has authorized as an originator of outbound email. So it
 would say Cox.net as or whoever is cable provider is as one of the authorized
 senders. Yeah I need to do that because I use Leo at LeoVille.com but it doesn't
 come from LeoVille.com it comes from other and so it's actually what I do in
 the reply to field is I use the the real you know ISP address in the reply to
 which sometimes confuses people because they say well what is this I'm sending
 it to right right and in fact it mean the the good news is the the that the SPF
 protocol is very rich you're able to give IP ranges you can give network
 addresses you can give domain names you can do you know comma separated lists
 you're able to really specify in a very nice and rich fashion what set of
 machines on the internet you you know are allowed to be senders of email from
 your domain and it's it's really cool huh and really complicated and one of
 these days I'm gonna understand it and I'm gonna fix it but meanwhile if you don't
 get email from me it could be that's why at least you tried at least I tried
 it's just bounced around just bounced around the net awhile yeah I mean I am
 completely sympathetic with the ISPs but so many of us now use this kind of
 forwarding technique yeah it's just I don't know what there's I don't know we've
 got to find a way down in Wyoming Michigan and if that's not confusing
 maybe his question will be I know it's that accused me go wait a minute
 Wyoming Michigan sure enough there is a there is a town with the state name in
 Michigan I've been hoping to hear some follow-up on EI's blink program now that
 there's been a few weeks to test it out does it work as advertised how much does
 blink slow down a system if at all any noticeable failings or is more testing
 required I have to defer to you Leo I know that you had installed it for a
 while I just haven't gotten around to it and so I wanted to put for Dale and
 everyone else who's probably wondering the same thing I wanted to say I don't
 know yet it's a lot like a firewall in the sense that when it sees outbound
 traffic it doesn't know about it asks for permission so you get those pop-ups
 initially I have done very limited testing on just one or two machines here's
 what I found so far it does seem to slow the machine down appreciably as you
 would expect it's doing a lot of security it's doing a lot of stuff it is it can
 be intrusive in the sense that it's a very strong firewall so for instance I
 was using a synergy KVM system that uses ethernet to to pass a mouse back and
 forth between two different systems that of course was immediately blocked and I
 had to go in and say okay no I want that port to be open but it does seem I mean
 now here's the problem and I'm not equipped and I don't know if you are but
 to test you know the the how well it provides security I mean I'm just saying
 I didn't get any bugs while I was using it but there are suites you know leak
 tests suites and so forth you do one I know Steve and there's other ways to test
 these things against viruses and against attacks and against leaks and I haven't
 done that so I don't know well I do know from looking at some of the feedback in
 in our in the GRC security now forum which is I will again commend to our
 youth to our listeners you need to have a a news group reader configured to news
 dot GRC dot com to get there but it's it's a fantastic news group I mean I
 depend upon it to for sort of a real dynamic real-time feedback from the
 group of people who both listen to this podcast and hang out you know on our
 news group server they immediately jumped on blink and there were you know
 there was I had good reports and bad reports there was someone who complained
 that blink didn't like the protocol that his news group reader was was using some
 of the packets were being flagged as potentially hostile by blink so there
 was an instance of a false positive some people perform did notice a performance
 hit others whether there was one or not didn't notice or or or complain so and
 there was one problem that is that apparently in some independent analysis
 is says is is blink did not fare well in the classic leak test tests because it's
 really not trying to compete in that category you know it's it's working to
 prevent bad stuff from getting in rather than trying to after something gets in
 create containment for something that that gets in so you know the leak tests
 that are checking it for like cross-process vulnerabilities and and and code
 injection exploits there are programs that will do a much better job of that
 because that's what they're trying to protect against whereas blink is saying
 you know we're gonna protect you from unknown vulnerabilities and the bad
 news is that's a hard thing to test you know I mean I know that the EI guys have
 a suite of junk that they then they they blast at their machines typical users
 don't so it is hard to independently verify it exactly as you said Leo yeah
 the tests you're talking about I think are from a to say my to sec M A T O U S E C
 dot com and they rated blink very poor along with a lot of well known firewall
 programs including zone alarm free and say the Komodo is the free Komodo COMODO
 is the best anti leak detection and unfortunately what has happened is
 Komodo while it's the best it has been written to be the best right it's
 designed for leak tests it is exactly they they went in and they solved they
 they deliberately fixed every type of exploit right that was being tested for
 so it doesn't you know it doesn't really mean anything except that it's the best
 solution for leak tests it doesn't say anything about what would happen if if a
 bad packet and an exploit came in through a protocol that you were
 deliberately allowing right and took over your machine that's what blink blocks
 and as far as I know nothing else does right yeah that's that difficult it's so
 hard to test security application it's just really tough and I don't even
 attempts to do it I would I would say if you my my impression of blink is if you
 have a a relative who is you know you really want to lock this person down
 maybe it's a teenager who uses file sharing software maybe it's your mom
 who's just not that sophisticated and they can tolerate a little bit of slow
 down blink is probably the best way to just kind of lock their machine down
 well and and given its track record which I I think is is proven where it is
 preemptively blocking things months I mean many months you know not quite
 years but but chunks of years in advance of they're being fixed I think it's
 still valuable protection Brandon writing from an undisclosed location asks a few
 weeks ago I remember hearing an episode that talked about a program that would
 show hard drive usage by program but I can't remember the name do you remember
 what that was I really do and it's something I rely upon it's free it's
 called space monger S-P-A-C-E-M-O-N-G-E-R he wants the free version which is
 version war it got up to version 1.4 and then Sean the program's author
 decided okay I'm going to start again I'm going to really do an amazing one
 which is not free it's version two point something or other I find that the free
 1.4 is everything I need what I love about it is that it gives you a a
 graphical map of the of your hard drive where you can see using a series of
 nested rectangles where your hard drive space went you know it's like wait a
 minute I have 120 gigs drive and now I've only got 10 gig free where did it go
 and so with this thing you instantly see for example those nine DVDs at 4.7
 gigs each that you ripped on your hard drive and then forgot about because
 they're sitting there occupying a huge rectangular chunk of your screen and you
 go oh and right click on it and delete them right there so it's a very cool
 tool and it's free and I you know I just love it spacemonger.com or I think it's
 spacemonger and into Google it's called old spacemonger that's the 1.4 and he
 I'm sure he wishes I weren't telling everyone it's all they need but
 unfortunately he wrote a really good one before he tried to obsolete it and it
 just works beautifully and it's free there are a number of other programs that
 do this kind of thing in fact there's that open source one on source forge I'm
 trying to remember the name of it yeah but Leah I don't like it are you try to
 you it's not nearly as nice okay yeah it just it doesn't that I was using
 something called disk mapper from the guy who originally created instant
 recall I think that was the tool it was it was something it was an old DOS app I
 was using as my my my general repository of all information really cool tool and
 he came out with it with disk mapper which I purchased years ago but it really
 hasn't kept up and for you know again this thing is free and it just works
 perfectly spacemonger and there are equal programs on OS 10 as well as matter of
 fact but I don't remember their names either somebody called the radio show and
 I've been trying to find them ever since a number of people you made them
 mail them and now I've forgotten again so anyway but you've got one
 spacemonger Jeff B being irradiated by his city somewhere in Tennessee writes
 this long but terrific note I'm wondering what you guys think about the
 ever-growing implementation of public Wi-Fi the thus the irradiation that I
 get it now yeah both by cafes and such as well as entire cities I keep hearing
 about places that are putting it up for the public to use but I rarely see anyone
 talk about the security or lack thereof well you must accept it on show yeah or
 my radio show or any of the other that just plain bugs me to be honest worse yet
 it's almost like some places try to cover up the security implications just to make
 the whole thing look better case in point my town is implementing a citywide Wi-Fi
 access my town is doing the same as a matter of fact it's been boasted about
 on the news and newspaper is a great way to attract more businesses to the area
 and such and I think that's true sounds like flawed logic but whatever anyway I
 got tired of the total lack of the security aspect being covered and I
 responded to a story about it on the local newspapers website in the comments
 section pointing out some of the implications to not being particularly
 careful one on public Wi-Fi ways to protect yourself I was careful to sound
 polite and helpful but despite other comments showing up mind never did only
 one praising it ever appeared people are thinking and being fed that it's just
 the best things and sliced bread who then thinks it's fine to go and do
 everything they do at home over and having no idea that all normal traffic
 can be snooped in general along with more directed methods such as art
 poisoning SSL man in the middle attacks etc etc even various folks that think
 they're being careful by not doing things such as begging don't realize it
 every time they load a page they're throwing cookies out at every HTTP
 request to a site depending on the site that makes it incredibly easy then to
 hijack their accounts also shall I go on also they pointed out in the paper that
 this city Wi-Fi isn't made to replace their home internet in one sentence toward
 the bottom of the article but you know as well as I do as soon as people could
 pick it up from their homes they'll drop their cable DSL in a heartbeat I don't
 know if I have a point this message other than expressing my utter dismay at the
 lack of protecting people's privacy but obviously it's not just a local problem
 and it's only gonna get worse as more places think it's a great idea to slap
 some Wi-Fi right Peters up around town in effort to make themselves seem more
 technological or whatever nonsense sign at the end yeah yeah Jeff B we're not
 sure where he is probably out on a sidewalk somewhere in Tennessee he has a
 good point I mean certainly we talk about it a lot I probably talk about it
 every other show on the radio show because that's really the best platform I
 have for getting information out about securing yourself and Wi-Fi I mean the
 radio show is listened to by a much more general audience and this is if you
 listen to security now we don't have to tell you about this stuff yeah and I
 guess I mean it must be the case that any really public Wi-Fi system that is
 spread like that it's in there's no protocol so for security right it's it's
 an all open system and unfortunately unless the users use VPN tunneling in
 order to tunnel themselves through a secure tunnel out of the wireless domain
 onto a wired backbone which then goes to the internet everything they do is wide
 open and his you know his point about grabbing HTTP session cookies is a
 really a good one because it's so easy to hijack someone's session if the server
 is relying on a cookie to identify them and those are unless they're over an
 SSL connection to the website those are in the clear and I mean easily sniffable
 right and then you could use it to have a path because password could be there
 well I just imagine the horror stories we're gonna start hearing after this
 becomes widespread Leo and you know people are just sitting there sucking in
 public traffic you know everywhere in a city and go into town although I know
 that a number of these providers are looking and I'm not sure how it works
 but they're looking at ways to make these things more secure well I've had a T
 mobile account for a couple months now and I have to say I was very impressed
 first of all I was obviously very skeptical when I went to the whole notion
 of a public Wi-Fi public hotspot but they do nothing but full WPA encryption
 that is you cannot set it up open you cannot use it with web they have their
 own little client and it is WPA so but that's a paid service yes it is and
 that's the key there and if you're gonna do an open hotspot which is what
 municipal Wi-Fi frequently is yep that is inherently insecure unless they've
 come up with something to make it more secure but I don't know you know I mean
 I read about this everywhere we talk about it all the time I don't think the
 message gets out to most people I don't know that's a very if it's an
 interesting question yeah I mean the only thing I could see that would be
 practical because you know you really we know now that web is so badly broke
 within it takes a minute to crack would would be some my actually there isn't a
 good solution because even if everyone had a WPA key if it was the same WPA
 key you just log in and get and be able to decrypt all the traffic then so you
 would need the enterprise class WPA where you're doing per client passwords so
 that you so that no two clients on the same access point are using the same
 key but now you're talking a seriously expensive infrastructure yeah I don't
 know what you do I think the really the word does need to get out and maybe free
 or inexpensive Wi-Fi security has to be made available you know hotspot you know
 VPN has to be made available if a city's gonna do this set up of VPN yeah but
 then again you've got people who won't bother and you know if you let them get
 on the net without security I think we're gonna maybe go through a period where
 there's a lot of pain and this gets a bad reputation before it finally gets
 fixed because again I think the barrier to entry the barrier to entry for a wide
 adoption has to be very low or people won't use it and very low means open it
 means insecure it means insecure exactly well once again with that we have come
 to the end of 12 good questions and and and even better answers you've done it
 you've done it again Steve I don't know how you do it I chose the questions oh
 that's how I think that helped well I I'm glad we did talk about it all of
 these subjects as usual fascinating stuff you learn so much we'll do this
 again and we're getting such great great great great great questions from our
 listeners so I do want to continue to encourage people to go to the bottom of
 the page the ever lengthening long page security now at you know grc.com/security
 now find your way to the bottom and there's a form anyone can fill out and
 unfortunately some bots are doing that now - oh man I have to do that I have to
 fix some to stifle the bots use a capture or something every time you
 actually that that's gonna be one of our future podcasts is titled are you
 human yeah yeah there's some interesting things going on to verify that it's a
 huge problem here's cool things at this path cat podcast this podcast as usual
 brought to you by the good folks at nerds on site at I want to be a nerd
 calm they're growing they need more nerds we need more nerds that's the call
 going out from nerds on site all over the world they need more nerds listen to
 this Canada US Mexico England Australia South Africa Bolivia and on and on and
 I was just in Vancouver the other day and I saw one of them driving by in those
 cute little nerds on site at neuron site they have Volkswagen bugs and they just
 so they're so cute the these are people who are experts in a lot of different
 fields PC Mac Cisco Oracle you name it nerds on site needs it fix it technicians
 website designers programmers project managers they need people in sales they
 need trainers they need security experts anti virus gurus especially
 especially those nerds who troubleshoot tear apart and rebuild their own
 systems just for fun if you're one of those people you need to be a nerd nerds
 are independent contractors so you'll you'll be in business for yourself but
 just not by yourself you focus on your passion and not the burdens of running
 a business find out more fact sign up to to go to a nerds only meeting in your
 area today at www dot I want to be a nerd dot com I want to be a nerd dot com
 nerds on sign we thank them so much for their support of security now can you
 believe it'll be our hundredth episode the next time we do this yeah very cool
 we're gonna have to do something special well you know I've been talking about
 having a special plan but I'm a little worried about time getting away from me
 I've been asked to keynote a conference at Harvard on spyware wow in a couple
 weeks and what the plan I had for the special hundredth episode is gonna take
 a lot of time and other things have been burning up my time until then so worry
 about it we're not doing anything special for Twitter either it will get
 there we get these milestones the milestone is in and of itself the
 success well it'll be fun to be there at a hundred in four weeks Leo
 we're gonna beat you though what's gonna be I know I know you you thought you might
 it was a horse race well who knows anything it happened it's not it's not
 done yet how far behind our four behind by the time this comes out we're
 recording this a little early but the time this comes out to it will have
 not done yeah sorry sorry Steve how well wait till we get to 200 we'll lap
 all right for more information about the things we talk about and of course
 16 kilobit versions for the bandwidth impaired transcripts to for those who
 like to read along you can go to grc.com that's Steve's website where you'll
 find all sorts of information about security now that's grc.com/security now
 you'll also find shields up his great program to test and his own leak test
 program to to test firewalls all the great security programs he offers for
 free and his bread and butter the great spin right the ultimate disc maintenance
 utility grc.com Steve have a great week we'll see you next Thursday you know
 Leo that you mentioned my own leak test utility mine is the dumbest one of
 them all and he's proud of it folks it is it is so dumb and it is the number one
 most downloaded thing I have is that funny I mean you know I'll come up with
 some new security thing and it'll for a couple weeks it'll be number one and
 then it slips back right down and leak test just sits there just being I don't
 know who's downloading it but I mean it's so dumb well now you know why the people
 like Komodo and the other firewalls are tuning their firewalls to be resilient
 to leak tests it's because of you people really do care people there's
 something about leak tests the people get it and they want it whatever it I
 don't know what it does but I want it yeah well believe me they got it six I
 don't know I don't even know what the count is now but it's still you just
 phenomenal number I should have charged for it Steve yeah friend of mine said
 just get a dollar for each one it's like look you don't understand the amount of
 overhead associated with getting a dollar I mean it's exactly yeah it's
 really substantial in fact it's funny one piece of email that I read while I was
 preparing for this Q&A asked me a really interesting question that I think I
 think I actually do a whole episode on he said you know Steve you've mentioned
 several times that you wrote your own e-commerce system from scratch what are
 you most proud of and least proud of that is like did you make any bad
 mistakes and I did make one that's really kind of funny and he said and you know
 what are you most proud about that's really an interesting question but it
 wasn't something that I can cram into a few minutes and I think people would
 find an interesting so we'll probably we'll do that one of these days I think
 that'll be a great subject let's do it well I'm most proud of bringing hundreds
 of thousands of people to show every week I think it's a really great public
 service and I thank you so much for doing it we will be we'll adjourn but we'll
 be back reconvene next week for more security information okay Steve and in
 the meantime Lee I'm not letting you go in the meantime I had the chance to
 bring up the download page leak test has been downloaded six million six hundred
 six more than more uses than shields up no no shields up is 50 million isn't it
 yeah yeah still if you charge the buck six million six hundred and sixty one
 thousand eight hundred and ninety two times wow and and about a thousand a day
 wow just a mind-boggling everybody who is you has used shields up to send Steve a
 dollar what no no no why I spin right because it'll be there when you need it
