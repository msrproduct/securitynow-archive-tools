 episode 798 for December 22nd 2020 our year's best stories hello everybody it's Leo I don't
 know how Steve does this mustache thing tickles it tickles we're giving Steve the week off
 you know he he takes no time off the man works his butt off not only you know with us with his
 with his products spin right and and all the research and stuff he does for his website grc.com
 but he spends you know hours putting together the security now show every week and the funny
 thing is about Steve he he never wants to take a day off he never wants to miss a show so I've tied
 him up and put him in a closet so he can't be here today because the guy needs a week off and we're
 going to take some of the best moments from the year 2020 starting with the story of and this was
 a bad one clear view AI and their face recognition technology so last week we talked about the clear
 view AI company who were doing the facial recognition uh and bragging that they scraped
 the web for three billion face prints and made them available to 600 police departments so they
 could identify people within seconds since then clear view has increased their collection of cease
 and desist letters which is not exactly what they are hoping to be collecting from major
 u.s. social media players the first one they they received was from twitter a couple weeks ago
 when twitter told clear view to stop collecting its data and to delete whatever it had in addition
 facebook has similarly demanded that clear view stop scraping photos because the that action
 violates facebook's policies and now google and youtube are also both telling clear view to stop
 violating their policies against data scraping clear views take on this is defiance uh the
 ceo hon ton fat was interviewed last wednesday morning on cbs's this morning news show uh he told
 listeners to trust him he said the technology is only to be used by law enforcement and only to
 identify potential criminals ton fat claims that the results which is which is not encouraging are
 ninety nine point six percent accurate i guess though you wouldn't want to be miss i you wouldn't
 want a false positive to misidentify you as a bad guy so i guess accuracy is is a better thing um
 and he also claimed that it's his right to collect public photos to feed into his facial recognition
 archive he said there's also a first amendment right to public information so the way we have
 built our system is to only take publicly available information and index it that way
 and we by the way there was a recent supreme court decision having to do what was a supreme
 court but maybe ninth circuit court having to do with scraping of linkedin in which they ruled
 yep you can't stop scraping if it's public information yep can't stop it in fact i have that i have a
 mention of that here uh so we know from last week when we talked about this that in in illinois
 at least with their bippa the biometric information privacy act uh you know it's illegal there uh and
 youtube's statement read quote youtube's terms of service explicitly forbid collecting data
 that can be used to identify a person clear view has publicly admitted to doing exactly that
 and in response we sent them a cease and desist letter um as for facebook uh facebook said last
 tuesday that it has demanded that clear view stop scraping photos because the action violates its policies
 um uh uh facebook said we have serious concerns that clear views practices which is
 with sorry serious concerns with clear views practices which is why we've requested information
 as part of our ongoing review how they respond will determine the next steps we take which i'm sure
 facebook intended to sort of sound ominous um and uh uh taunt that defended clear view as being a
 google-like search engine he said google can pull in information from all different websites
 if it's public and it can be inside oh sorry excuse me if it's public and it can be inside google's
 search engine it can be in hours as well google disagreed saying that clear view isn't at all
 like their search engine google said there's a big difference between what we do and the way
 you're shang-hying everyone's face images without their consent most websites want to be included
 in google search and we give webmasters control over what information from their site is included
 in our search results including the option to opt out entirely google said clear view secretly
 collected image data of individuals without their consent and in violation of rules explicitly
 forbidding them from doing so so the question is when is public information not public which brings
 me to the point you raised leo back in 2016 a company called high q which i recall we talking
 about at the time a san francisco startup was marketing two products which depended upon
 whatever data linkedins 500 million members had chosen to make public there was the for the first
 product they called keeper which identified employees who might be ripe for being recruited
 and skills mapper summarized a linkedin members skills in that instance high q was a massing
 public information grabbing the same material that anyone could get from linkedin without having to
 log in so any browser would display the same information high q was vacuuming up organizing
 and reselling and when sufficiently analyzed inferences could be made to alert companies for
 example when their pivotal employees might be interviewing for another position and you can do
 much more as we know with this kind of advanced informatics yeah and that interesting you you
 put a flag to be notified when when any of your employees linkedin profiles indicate maybe they're
 you know uh taking that that longer lunch break was a little more than a lunch break
 okay so in the case of high q linkedin sent a cease and desist letter alleging that it was
 violating serious anti hacking and anti copyright violation laws and linkedin cited the computer
 fraud and abuse act the c_f_a_a_ the digital millennium copyright act that did the dmca that
 we've talked about so much and california penal code uh section 502 c whatever that is linkedin
 uh which which when this is a little interesting aside had been exploring how to do the same thing
 with its own data that high q had achieved also noted that it had blocked high q from accessing
 its data and as you mentioned it was just this last this past september in 2019 an appeals court
 told linkedin to back off and that it had no legal right to interfere with high q's profiting
 from its users publicly available data the court protected data scraping of public data
 in what at first looks like a major legal precedent but it's actually a lot less clear
 our friends at the electronic frontier foundation wrote quote while this decision represents
 an important step to putting limits on using the c_f_a_a_ the computer fraud and abuse act because
 you know the concern has been that it's being abused uh to intimidate researchers with the
 legalese of cease and desist letters the ninth circuit sadly left the door open to other claims
 such as trespass to chattels or even copyright infringement that might allow actors like linkedin
 to limit competition with its products so essentially the ninth circuit didn't go as far
 as our e_f_f_ folks wished it had but in this case at least it said hey uh you you linkedin
 are not lawfully allowed to prevent somebody from visiting your site with automated scrapers
 and obtain whatever information has been made public by your users um and of course the problem
 is the at the c_f_a_a_ the computer fraud and abuse act is broadly written and subject to
 multiple conflicting interpretations across different federal circuits this makes it likely
 that the supreme court will ultimately be forced to resolve the meaning of terms which are not
 really clear the c_f_a_a_ says for example without authorization well people want to take
 without authorization the way that they want to uh in this of course is bad this this occurs with
 broadly uh written legislation that just ends up having to it's a problem for everyone and ends
 up having to get resolved in the courts um the e_f_f_s_ surveillance litigation director there is
 there is such a person this sort their surveillance litigation director jennifer lynch said that clear
 view is the latest example so now we're talking about clear view the the the facial scraping people
 uh that doesn't sound right facial well anyway uh is the latest
 yes you get that done soft uh yeah it's covered by insurance is the latest example of why we need
 laws that ban or at least pause pending more clarification law enforcement's secret of use
 of facial biometric recognition she cited many cases of what she called law enforcement's
 and clear views specifically abuse of facial recognition stating quote police abuse of facial
 recognition technology is not theoretical it's happening today law enforcement has already used
 live face recognition on public streets and at political protests and of course as we've observed
 before this is all being enabled by the recent incredible reductions in cost the cost of processing
 power has crashed the cost of mass storage has collapsed the cost and presence of ubiquitous
 networking communications just doesn't cost anything anymore to send data all you know massive data
 all over the place we didn't have this 10 years ago and leo uh although the podcast will run out
 by the by 10 years from now uh we'll still be around and we'll see what what we have 10 years
 if anybody recognizes us this year was full of attempts by congress to thwart encryption to end
 section 230 to really turn the internet upside down and all of course began last year uh with the
 end of net neutrality this year we had a new enemy the earn it act steve explained why it's a real
 problem okay now leo uh i know your pea if you should i'm not sure if you should take your blood
 pressure before or after this one i know all about this one we've been talking about for a while it is
 oh and what's sad is they're sneaking this through during this covid crisis because they know that
 nobody'll pay any attention to it i even saw um uh one of them i think dick bloomin's all say we
 don't i'm so disappointed i am too we don't mention anything about encryption we're not talking about
 encryption uh well you better explain okay so it truly does appear that our government uh
 embodied by crypto naive politicians maybe willfully so is one way or another going to figure out how
 to break into the encryption protection assets of american citizens the most recent effort dubbed
 on a boy the the earn it act yeah is gonna earn it is almost despicable okay first of all earn it
 is the most tortured abbreviation we've encountered in some time it's a retro nim
 oh my god they come up with the name and then they say what it stands for they figure it
 ever has that been more obvious than now it stands for eliminating abusive and rampant neglect
 of interactive technologies we've been neglecting them i think lindsey was so proud of himself
 okay so get a load of them it's lindsey graham and dick bloomin's all the yeah a load of this
 yeah uh what is it that strong data encrypting companies would be earning
 the legislation proposes to strip the to strip the protection provided by section 230 of the
 communications decency act from certain apps and companies which would then hold them responsible
 for user uploaded content unless they provide a means for lawful access to their encryption
 protected content that in other words they're holding ransom the because these are unrelated
 issues yes yes they're they're completely independent they are they're ransoming
 this necessary section of of this section 230 of the communications decency act
 which social media companies have to have uh and everything about this is slimy so in other words
 the legal protections that currently serve they're in place to hold all of our online social media
 companies harmless for whatever their users post would now need to be earned by allowing law
 enforcement to have decryption access sadly urnit is a bipartisan effort having been introduced by
 no surprise anti-encryption crusader lindsey graham and also richard bloomin thaw and other
 legislators who continually use the specter of online child exploitation to argue for the
 weakening of encryption remember that we discussed this back in december end of last year
 while grilling facebook and apple lindsey threatened to regulate encryption
 unless the companies gave law enforcement access to encrypted user data while pointing
 to child abuse he said quote you're going to find a way to do this or we're going to do it for you
 we're not going to live yeah we're not going to live in a world oh did you hear about how the
 our illustrious doj it gets isn't isn't the loop here anyway we're not going to live in a world
 where a bunch of child abusers have a safe haven to practice their craft period said lindsey end of
 discussion close quote so the eff notes that one of the problems with the urnit bill among many
 is that the proposed legislation offers no meaningful solution to the problem of child
 child exploitation in other words it's got nothing to do with it the eff wrote
 quote it doesn't help organizations that support victims it doesn't equip law enforcement agencies
 with resources to investigate claims of child exploitation or training in how to use online
 platforms to catch perpetrators rather the bill's authors have shrewdly used defending children
 as the pretense for an attack on our free speech and security online it's a straw man
 uh-huh if passed the legislation will create a quote national commission
 on online child sexual exploitation and prevention okay is that an acronym it doesn't look like it
 tasked with developing on here it is best practices for owners of internet platforms
 to quote prevent reduce and respond to child exploitation online but as the eff maintains
 best practices would essentially translate to legal requirements they said if a platform
 failed to adhere to them it would lose essential legal protections for free speech meaning section
 230 it turns out that the best practices approach arose from a pushback over the bill's predicted
 effects on privacy and free speech they had to get extra slimy pushback that caused its authors
 to roll out the new structure the best practices would be subject to approval or veto by the attorney
 general currently william bar who has himself already issued a public call for backdoors
 the homeland of the secretary of homeland security who has made a similar call
 the chair of the ftc the federal trained commission ditto again everybody wants uh encryption bypass
 cnet talked to lindsey barret who's a staff attorney at george town uh law institute for public
 representation communications and technology who said that the way that the bill is structured
 is a clear indication that it's meant to target encryption he said when you're talking about a bill
 that is structured for the attorney general to give his opinion and have decisive influence
 over what the best practices are it does not take a rocket scientist to concur he said that this is
 designed to target encryption if the bill passes the choice for tech companies comes down to either
 weakening their own encryption and endangering the privacy and security of all their users
 or forgoing section 230 protections and potentially facing a liability wave of lawsuits a senior
 legal counsel for the aclu said the removal of section 230 liability essentially makes the best
 practices a requirement the cost of doing business without those immunities is too high
 so bravo use slimy snakes the thing that makes us slimy is if they were to be forthright and
 propose a bill look we don't like um the fact that bad guys including predators child predators
 can hide behind encryption let's make encryption illegal if they were to propose that bill
 which is really what they want everybody we we'd all stand up and say no no so they're sneaking it in
 they don't mention as bloomin thaw pointed out it was mentioned encryption it just has the impact
 it's actually clever yeah but it points out that there isn't i don't think and they've run up against
 this before the will in this country people understand why breaking encryption is a bad thing
 so they're not gonna they're gonna sneak around us so we all have to sit up and take notice
 section 230 has been under assault for one for a long time and that's another big problem yes
 yes it gives it gives uh these online companies the same kind of protection the phone company has
 at that you cannot prosecute AT&T if a bad guy plans yeah calls you up and says plans let's plan
 an attack on the united states you can't say oh that's AT&T's fault it's not AT&T's job to listen to
 every phone call and make sure nobody's planning sedition and no we don't want that no yes we don't
 want that in our society it'd make the phone company untenable it wouldn't use it so well that's
 the other side of this is you can't stop encryption it's done right right so this is pushed just
 pushes it on the ground eliminates protections for us normal people honest people and uh and and
 makes it possible for bad guys to get into anything we do as well such a bad idea there is a petition
 you can sign i mean i would go out and do that let them know that they didn't fool us well and
 the problem is by by by so cleverly cutting this pie the way they have where they made the cut one
 also wonders i mean clearly this will be challenged it'll go through the courts it'll it may end up
 getting uh up to the supreme court and again it's like oh would you know would it get overturned or
 not i mean uh zoom go boom um based in san jose california zoom video communications ink provides
 as we know a video conferencing focused communications platform using desktop and web browser clients
 so you get cloud video conferencing online meetings group messaging there's also some some
 group and private chat features in there in virtual online conferences um while all of the online
 conferencing systems have seen a significant jump in their usage once this outbreak of the coronavirus
 driven coven 19 disease forced virtually all physical meetings of any kind into cyberspace
 for whatever reason zoom was the system that most caught on maybe it sounds fun uh i don't know
 apparently was due to nearly instantaneous word of mouth spread you know what do you use i use
 zoom okay i'll use it too uh and so it went uh and it's relatively easy to use um however
 creating something of a stress test for zoom the past month has shown that it's less easy to
 use it securely that not using it securely can have immediate and often embarrassing consequences
 that for many purposes it may not be practical to use it securely just because of logistics uh
 and also some potentially serious bugs have surfaced as a consequence of the greater scrutiny
 which has been brought to bear so to get some sense of scale zoom's usage has skyrocketed
 from 10 million daily users before the coronavirus last december to now 200 million daily users
 uh so a 20 fold user increase uh and that's resulted in a 535 increase in daily traffic
 to its download page just in the last month the company itself went public a year ago last April
 and its stock price recently peaked in mid-March at more than twice what it had been in december
 so it doubled while the rest of the dow stocks crashed uh in the last few months
 um the most apparent problem was that in the rush to move online many of zoom's useful security
 features initially went unused um as we know adding a password to anything especially if it's
 optional makes that thing's use less simple even though it makes it somewhat more secure
 so and passwords on zoom conferences are optional so early on everything from boardroom
 meetings to a schoolroom classes to online yoga were quickly placed online with initially without
 passwords uh those organizing the meetings apparently gave little thought to the possibility
 that anyone would want to crash the party uh you know and there's like a zoom meeting code
 which i guess they figured was obscure enough but oh what a mistake that was uh and you know even
 if a password was added to a meeting um both the meetings code and it's protecting in quotes
 password must still be provided to everyone wishing to attend so when a school district
 posted its zoom based meeting codes and passwords on their public website
 well uh stand back the world now has a new term zoom bombing uh and it's become a sub industry
 of its own uh and in retrospect it was completely foreseeable that now we have every board teenager
 now also stuck at home on the internet just itching to cause some and here comes my favorite word
 mayhem uh uh arse technica briefly some things up last thursday writing with the corona virus
 pandemic forcing millions of people to work learn and socialize from home zoom conferences
 are becoming a default method to connect and with popularity comes abuse enter zoom bombing
 the phenomenon of trolls intruding into other people's meetings for the sole purpose of harassing
 the attendees usually by bombarding them with racist or sexually explicit images or statements
 arse wrote a small sample of the events over the past few days and they had three
 and attendee who disrupted an alcohol anonymous meeting by shouting misogynistic and anti-semitic
 slurs along with the statement alcohol is so good according to business insider meeting
 organizers eventually muted and removed the intruder but only after more than half of the
 participants had left second example a zoom conference hosting students from the orange county
 public school system in florida there was disrupted after an unvided participant exposed himself
 to the class and third an online meeting of black students at the university of texas
 there was cut short when it was interrupted by visitors using racial slurs so you know
 the typical hijinks but a problem when you're trying to do all this online and it's possible
 to be have these meetings interrupted and not only can online conferences be held on the internet
 but zoom bombing raids can also be organized using the internet's social media tools just as easily
 zdnet wrote the internet is rife with online communities where users can go and share zoom
 conference codes and request that pranksters connect and hurl insults play pornographic material
 excuse me or make death threats against other participants in a practice called zoom bombing
 or a zoom raid they said these zoom bombing incidents had rapidly increased to become a
 favorite pastime for all the teenagers stuck in their homes during quarantines from a niche
 prank that started on a derelict discord channel zoom bombing they wrote has now spread to enormous
 proportions being so rampant these days that the fbi sent a nationwide alert last week urging
 companies schools and universities to take steps to secure their zoom channels but as zoom bombing
 became more popular more pranksters wanted to join in the fun and more users wanted their friends
 zoom meetings disrupted as the old saying goes they wrote where there's a demand there's always a
 supply over the course of the past week the number of places on the public internet where a zoom raid
 can be requested from a gang of bored teenagers has exploded there are now more than 30 public
 discord channels there are at least three subreddits and multiple twitter accounts where zoom conference
 codes and passwords can be posted to be broadcast to the internet and there are threads on at least
 three hacking forums where users are either sharing zoom conference codes or techniques to discover live
 meetings some examples of discord posts revealed by pc magazines report uh root reporting include
 quote can anybody troll my science class at nine fifteen or i have a class in 30 minutes that i'll
 send a link for or my friend's going to give me the code to her high school pre-calc class
 tomorrow morning so as i noted above zoom does provide for password protected meetings but when
 an entire class of teenagers at home are provided with the zoom meeting code and it's accompanying
 password it's easy for any of them to post those credentials anonymously to get their virtual
 classroom disrupted by a friend or anybody on the internet now fortunately the zoom system
 does offer some additional controls to control and prevent such disruption zoom offers a virtual
 waiting room where wannabe participants can be held staged and vetted before being admitted
 into the conference and once all vetted participants have been added essentially once a virtual
 roll call is complete zoom conferences can be locked to prevent anyone else from wandering in
 late very much like locking the classroom door once class has begun and it's also possible to
 prevent anyone other than the host from sharing their screen with the conference which only makes
 sense though it's not currently the default since the system was originally meant to be open and
 friendly and collaborative um so this is what's going to have to happen moving forward and of course
 all that requires much more hands-on management it's not nearly as simple as publicly posting
 the access codes and everything works smoothly but welcome to the internet uh that's the way it's
 going to have to be um and that's the usage side's tip and i should mention that since i posted the
 show notes i just checked with twitter uh and there's a at least one person who read through
 this already who's uh an admin at a company who is using zoom and gave it the thumbs up he said he
 appreciated and liked everything that i had had suggested so uh it looks like this is good advice
 so as i said that's the usage side uh which has immediately become necessary for managing the
 rampant abuse of zoom meetings uh not surprisingly as i said at the top there were some technical
 service some problems that have surfaced as a result of more scrutiny being brought to bear
 last wednesday a piece in ours technica stated that quote users of zoom for windows beware
 the widely used software has a vulnerability that allows attackers to steal your operating
 system credentials uh they were quoting researchers so perhaps that's what the researchers said
 it wasn't exactly true though it's definitely a serious vulnerability or it was uh it would be
 more correct to say that it was a credential impersonation attack uh the zoom chat window
 could be used to send targeted windows users a string of text that represented a network resource
 on the windows device they were using the zoom app for windows would automatically
 convert these unc that's the universal naming convention strings such as backslash backslash
 attacker dot bad domain dot com backslash c dollar sign uh c is the default share the default
 windows share for your main c drive the zoom app would convert these into clickable links
 if the target clicked on those links in the chat on networks that are not locked down
 zoom would send the windows user names and the corresponding network ntlm v2 hashes
 to the address contained in the link that is out onto the public internet to the attacker
 attackers could then use these credentials to access those default shared network resources
 like c colon uh outlook servers storage devices whatever um and this is caused by the fact that
 a windows network will accept the ntlm man the ntlm hash when authenticating a user that leaves
 the networks open to smb relay attacks that can be used to gain unauthorized access to various
 resources these attacks don't require cracking the hash to reverse it to its plain text password
 replaying the existing hash is sufficient for authentication and as i've said many times before
 microsoft has never really managed to make any of its in-house protocols secure
 which is why none of them should ever be exposed to the internet um okay so
 it's worth noting that since all of this is happening over port 445 any zoom user
 who is behind an isp who is already already proactively filtering the typical range of
 highly abused ports i'm a cocks cable user all a minor filtered um so those are typically ports 25
 you know smtp ports 137 through 139 old school file and printer sharing and 445
 the new smb port uh those are typically all blocked so many home users were were never in any danger
 they will always have been protected from the remote ex ex exploitation of this flaw
 because they hackers not able to get back in uh but it's way better not to have this problem
 and immediately upon having it brought to their attention zoom repaired and updated their client
 to close this hole so problem solved but it was there for a while and spooky um and of course
 there's more it's been revealed that zoom conference connections are not truly end-to-end encrypted
 as they claim and that zoom is able to see all of their conference content unencrypted i can
 understand this since hosting a massive conference with true end-to-end encryption would be a bit
 tricky all of the participants would need to be sharing a common symmetric key that zoom itself
 didn't have access to obviously that can be done uh and zoom didn't have to do it the way it did
 but in anyway instead what's happened is each conference participants data stream is encrypted
 to zoom but decrypted there and subsequently re-encrypted to all other participants
 i think in general that's how a conference a system would have to work you can't do end-to-end
 encryption if you're going to have a central server right and somebody somebody's going to mix it
 yeah you you are able to uh and apparently in some instances there's does but if you turn on value
 added features then uh it doesn't happen okay so um also in subsequent research by citizen lab
 uh they found that zoom was also vague about the type of encryption being used and that the keys
 generated for cryptographic operations were being delivered to participants in a zoom meeting
 through servers in china even when all meeting participants uh and the zoom subscribers company
 were outside of china uh apparently that was a mistake they did some quick footwork and explained
 it away and said it's been fixed but it was happening for a while and the audio and video in each zoom
 meeting is encrypted and decrypted with a single AES 128 cipher used in ECB mode which is shared
 among all participants as we know ECB mode is electronic code book uh that is not a chaining cipher
 each block is independently encrypted without dependence upon anything that came before
 the result is that patterns present in the plaintext are preserved through encryption
 which is considered to be a serious security weakness zooms original privacy policy also came
 under criticism because it was possible for zoom to collect extensive data about its users videos
 transcripts and shared notes and share it with third parties for profit whoops on march 29th zoom
 tightened its privacy policy to state that it doesn't use data for meetings for any advertising
 but it does use the data when people visit its marketing websites including its homepages zoom
 dot us and zoom dot com zooms ios app like many apps which use the facebook sdk was found to be
 sending analytics data back to facebook even when the user doesn't have a linked facebook account
 zoom later removed that feature zoom came under the lens for its attendee tracking feature
 which when enabled let's a host check if participants are clicking away from the main zoom window during
 a call on april second it permanently removed the attendee attention tracker function zoom was found
 to be using an undisclosed data mining feature that automatically matched users names and email
 addresses to their linkedin profiles when they were signed in even if they were anonymous or using a
 pseudonym during their call if another user in their meeting was subscribed to a service called
 linkedin sales navigator they were able to access the linkedin profiles of other participants in
 their zoom meetings without those user's knowledge or consent zoom has now disabled that feature
 vice magazine discovered and revealed that zoom was leaking thousands of users email addresses
 and photos and letting strangers initiate calls with each other it turned out that was because
 users with the same domain name in their email address get this leo users with the same domain
 name in their email address that is using lesser known email providers other than gmail outlook
 hotmail or yahoo which zoom had special case were being grouped together as if they worked
 for the same company whoops zoom has selectively blacklisted those domains though the whole thing
 seemed like a bad idea to me last friday the washington post reported that it was trivial to
 find video recordings made in zoom by searching the internet for the common file naming pattern
 that zoom automatically applies to video recordings these videos were found on publicly accessible
 amazon storage buckets it's not a biggie since that was relying upon obscurity rather than any
 security but still researchers have created a tool called z war dial that searches for open zoom
 meeting ids finding around a 100 open and non password protecting protected meetings per hour
 the good news is zoom has been response has been responding to each and every one of these issues
 quickly and it does appear that given its existing feature set it can be used and put to good purpose
 so long as tight control is maintained over those who are allowed to participate those although
 exerting such control might be difficult for very large meetings you know in a typical virtual
 classroom that ought to be workable their use of a es 128 in ecb mode is a red flag
 from a strict security standpoint it basically means that zoom implemented its own cryptographic
 system which is not you know it's obviously to any obvious to anyone looking at it not very
 secure i can see the benefits of using ecb mode for a multi-way conferencing system it makes things
 much easier allowing late comers to more easily join into the fray but users should not assume
 that they have truly secure end-to-end encryption apparently no one using zoom really does but with
 that caveat okay for many people it doesn't matter you know for an otherwise public class
 classroom or a yoga class it's entirely sufficient of course covid-19 was a big topic for all of us
 all year long uh steve did a really i thought thoughtful breakdown of how the contact tracing
 api on uh on apple and android worked but ultimately i think he realized as we all did and in fact
 it's proven to be true that contact tracing apps probably are never going to work i believe it's
 doomed um as i mentioned at the top of the show some academics who have modeled the system
 have determined that to be effective 80 8 0 of all smartphone users would need to voluntarily
 opt into using the app and that's never going to happen 80 percent uh as we saw the instant
 the apple google initiative was announced both the non-technical and sadly the technical press
 went berserk over the privacy implications even highly technical individuals who should have
 known better spoke out with errant frightening and unfounded warnings before they understood
 how the system worked this podcast looked at the systems technology carefully and understood
 exactly what and why the apple google team had designed it as they did and we found that the
 api itself absolutely protects the user's privacy but in practice that doesn't matter at all
 that is the fact that it's you really can trust it for one thing as we've discussed since then
 health officials really do have a need to collect real-time geographical location data as part of
 a workable system adding the where you were when it happened would go a long way toward making up
 for a lack of pervasive use of an application for example if only a few people in a large gathering
 were app enabled and it was determined from the app that that was the most likely infection
 event then a call could be put out for other non-app-enabled people who were also present at that
 event to take the necessary precautions as we noted previously the importance of knowing where
 which apple and google scrupulously avoided using has already occurred to the state of utah
 who has created a much more useful solution which is also necessarily much more invasive
 even though it was thoughtfully designed with things like immediate user deletion of all data
 and short-term self-expiring location data the simple truth is a short term sacrifice of privacy
 is required for spreading events to be located and managed even fully human mediated contact
 tracing is by definition a short-term sacrifice of privacy someone whom you've never met and don't
 know anything about needs to interview you to determine everything you're willing to share
 about where you've been what you've done and who you've been in contact with for the previous two
 weeks and that better be complete yeah yeah don't lie that's that's a massive imposition on one's
 privacy right you know but it's what's necessary it's what works you know and i learned uh in doing
 the research about one of those new features in google the google says that people are constantly
 clearing their web browser histories and that's just cyber many people apparently really don't want
 anyone else to know where they've been and what they've been up to um and at least when interviewed
 by a human contact tracer someone can choose to elide anything they're embarrassed to share
 but you can't do that with an app so how many people are going to voluntarily install what
 amounts to spyware as we well know many people also have an inherent mistrust of the government
 and its motives we've already seen people worrying that this might just be the start of more pervasive
 monitor i mean even handy on mac break weekly was worrying about that the start of more pervasive
 monitoring with statements like i'm not quoting andi i had this already written if they are allowed
 to do this they'll always want more and why would they ever want to stop and so forth so
 no it was a noble idea i loved the cleverness of the technology it was fun to dissect it and
 share its operation with our users but it's clear that as a voluntary initiative it's never going
 to get off the ground so i just you know i to me the idea that of states using a more
 invasive technology as i noted really does make up for the fact it goes a long way toward making
 up for the fact that just not that many people are going to take advantage of it but for those
 who do who are involved in events where an infection is present if you know where and when
 then you're able to move that from cyber into physical and after all that's what human contact
 tracing is is you know physical contact monitoring so yeah i just i just think there's just no chance
 for for software based apps if they are voluntarily installed and Bruce snire brought up the really
 excellent point about and i don't know if rich niers a post a few days ago about i did not just
 the he agrees with you he says it's just it's just it's not going to it's just they don't work because
 of the potential for false negatives or false positives people aren't going to trust it
 and it's just going to it's just not going to work we need human contact tracing now i think
 these apps could be a useful adjunct to help it because one thing i don't remember where i've
 been everywhere i've been in the last 14 days yeah having that a map of that that maybe only i see
 or whatever that would be used with a jog your memory yeah there's a lot of things that could be
 useful but as constituted apple and google have done such a good job of protecting our privacy
 they've made their apps pretty much useless to human contract tracers and we know that human
 contact tracing is what's you need extensive testing and tracing period so yeah yeah uh
 unfortunately and i maybe it suffers a little bit from i think the apple google approach maybe
 suffer a little bit from just you know being developed by techies without contact from actual
 health officials who would have said wait we need that we have to know where where this happened
 it's not useful uh that's exactly what snier said he says a tech will always respond with what tech
 knows how to do because they want to help but that's not necessarily what needs to be done it's just
 what they can do and i think that's that i mean i agree they did it very well but it's just
 from a health perspective health uh official perspective it's not uh sufficient yeah i would
 love as i mentioned when we talked about utah i would love for the state of california to do an
 invasive health monitoring app and i would load it and well they're not using the google api they're
 not they're they're gonna do their own thing the problem in my opinion is i agree we need testing
 and we need human tracing it the the countries that that's been done and it has worked it's worked
 very well it's eliminated covid-19 cases just killed it just killed it uh but that's not i don't think
 it's ever gonna happen in the u.s we just we're not gonna sit still for that we won't even wear masks
 i agree this is a country founded on individual liberty and it's inconsistent with what is necessary
 to stop the virus that's why there's all the emphasis on well let's get a vaccine because they
 know there's nothing else that's gonna work uh right and what that means is many many many more
 people will die we'll have many more you know go back inside it's it's not over and then coming
 out and going back and this it's gonna be a bit of a seesaw for for a little while
 um yeah i think that's right yep we should just talk about twitter i think everybody by now leo
 knows that there was a big event that happened on wednesday of last week um twitter's the one
 thing that's missing from the most up-to-date information i've seen is any sense for who did it
 and i'm sure that's if they have any idea that's embargoed because they're not wanting to met
 getting the way of law enforcement or whatever forensics they may have the new york times finger
 to a guy named kirk oh i haven't heard i mean i don't think they've a so that's the identity he
 assumed they haven't associated that with a real person but there is a great new york times
 article where they talked it's interesting because kirk before he perpetrated this
 was reaching out to a bunch of sim swappers these are guys who aren't exactly malicious they make
 money by hacking single-letter twitter domains or or but they call og domain short clever twitter
 domains and selling them to the highest bidder like uh at six at six or at y right yep yep but
 these guys so kirk was talking to them saying look i can do these things you know how much would you
 pay but they got bored apparently according to their story anyway and they didn't follow up
 but then shortly thereafter he did use his admin console to perpetrate this spammy hack
 so is he a twitter employee we think no oh you didn't okay got to read the story because what
 and twitter has not admitted to this whether it's true is unknown but there seems to be good
 evidence that the way kirk got this twitter only says socially engineered our guys right is he got
 into their private slack channel where twitter had pinned the credentials for the god mode interface
 oh wow that's that's a good one oh man so all he really has to do is say hey let me in here slack
 channel yeah it's like your password on the blackboard it's supposed to know when the camera crew is
 gonna come in and do an interview can you believe it now that's the new york time story and i think
 that it's well sourced because they they got screenshots from these guys and they got a lot
 of stuff from these guys to verify that they were talking to this guy and so forth but twitter has
 not confirmed so isn't that fascinating well i'm glad to have glad that that you know we talked
 about this because you had more up-to-date information all i had was there yeah twitter's
 note from friday and you know they talked about 138 accounts and of the 138 45 were you know messed
 with and then eight people there was there had some internal tool called your twitter account or
 something that was used eight times so you know me and they're they're painting the best picture
 they they can um you know it's funny too because i i got an email from jason in the afternoon on
 wednesday saying hey steve we'd love to have you on thursday morning to talk about this on on our
 show um can can you do that i said yeah sure so i attempted to tweet the news to my followers
 that i would be on on thursday morning and i was blocked i got the weirdest like yeah you know this
 looks like a bot is trying to post so bought off and it's like yeah what i'm not a bot they were
 so i'm spending accounts too they were getting very aggressive about this yeah they didn't want
 anybody to talk about it because i'm sure yours was suspended too because you and i are both um uh
 what is it with the little were verified blue check verified yeah verified and so they did a blanket
 block of all verified users just and and then there were other people who had anyone who had
 changed their password recently that raised their flag of suspicion so they they blocked any posts
 from those accounts i mean you know they really did respond quickly as quickly as they could yeah
 yeah it's a it's a cool yeah this is the new york times article it came out on friday this is a
 fascinating story the reason it's it perhaps more important than just oh they hacked twitter which
 who cares is that the president uses this and many other leaders use this as a messaging system
 to tell the world what they're up to it's terrifying to think that any of these accounts could have
 been compromised and it was obvious when it started that it was not your it wasn't a password hack or
 your average everyday hack because accounts like bill gates and joe bines and barack obamas all of
 which were hacked almost certainly have higher levels of security on them right not just using
 monkey one two three as a password there's clearly had to be it was obviously an inside job yeah yeah
 that was our meat well and and the nature of the tweets it was a send you know two for one deal on
 bitcoin send you know whatever you send me i'll double it and send it back to you and you know
 the last i heard was the i think well i said on on thursday on on jason's show that that i had seen
 three hundred thousand dollars had been transferred into the bitcoin account i haven't seen that again
 i've seen more like a hundred and twenty thousand so some it's hard to tell out of money was made
 the nature we know the bitcoin account so you can look at the blockchain and see what was going on
 with it but hackers routinely will put put money into it take money out to obfuscate what they're
 making the best so i like you i saw hundred thousand but the best information came from binance
 which is a bitcoin exchange which said they had blocked a quarter of a million dollars of
 attempted transfers into that account so that's their customers saying i'd like to give some money
 to joe biden and get it doubled so it might have been a more successful hack than it appeared to be
 and if it weren't for binance blocking those transfers it could have been a lot more money
 it does make you wonder though if you had this god mode
 yes what would be the best for this yeah what would you do with it and maybe maybe this is
 misdirection maybe kirk is really you know vladimir and uh and he's up to other things so we don't
 and that's the why i wonder what's really going on here well and uh what i said when i was talking
 to jason on thursday was that you know i i i don't know whether he knew but you and i talked
 years ago at back at the sony entertainment hack where there was an advanced persistent threat
 that had been found in their network and you know i said famously on the podcast i don't want the
 job of trying to secure something like sony oh yeah you know that's impossible it's i mean literally
 impossible and so what what this suggests is that that clearly it was a mistake to if the credentials
 for this thing were you know stapled in the slack channel so that it could be seen but but also the
 idea that a that the bar is not higher to doing something like that for example and i and i talked
 about uh how you know there are protocols that use a majority voting approach with crypto where
 it's compromising a single individual wouldn't wouldn't render the company vulnerable you know
 you know a secret a shared secret could be shared for example among nine people but you've got to
 get three of them to all agree in order to cause something to happen that way if you have a large
 enough body of people who who can be involved you're not worried about getting locked out because
 you know mori is gone for the day but at the same time it just pretty it pretty i mean it's
 protecting the people from from being you know uh suckered into doing something with a social
 engineering attack so i i think this also suggests that you know twitter has become as you said
 leo so crucial i mean like bizarrely important on the globally important on the global scale
 well it also is it's kind of unconscionable because twitter is not the first so a contractor
 when leaving his job at twitter two years ago you might remember this disconnected president
 trumps account deleted it uh and then of course jack's account the ceo his account was hacked a
 couple of months ago you would think that at this point twitter would kind of be on notice
 yeah that maybe they should be doing a better job yeah this is just not a toy anymore yeah that
 you know that allows people to send 140 characters between their phones yeah it's it's become a lot
 more than that so and we should say hopefully new york time says that it was the slack channel that
 you know they got that from hackers and who knows if that's true but right right right so twitter
 is allegedly yeah to everything so far because and you know unless we get it officially and
 who knows when and or if what will get officially from twitter anyway here yeah yeah yeah yeah that's
 what's known and again sort of puts the industry on notice that this stuff which just started off
 being kind of like oh look uh are they are they making any money yet leo or they still waiting to
 make money in the future they've had profitable quarters but they're not exactly rolling in the
 dough yeah we don't really have an economic model but yeah we're gonna let the whole world use this
 to talk to itself and good luck yeah well we'll make it up in volume the best product of the year
 from the point of view of security now came to us uh well it was announcement it's not
 active from amazon you probably saw it the ring drone for your home okay so under our rhetorically
 named what could possibly go wrong section we have amazon rings announcement thursday of their
 autonomous home security flying webcam you know the thing that surprised me when i they announced
 this lisa has forbidden cameras in the house for yes slightly so you know she doesn't know what that
 video is going i said yeah you look at this you wouldn't want this she's oh no why are we gonna get
 it like oh well because if cameras hidden in the base until it takes off true right but in order to
 use it you have to map your home you actually have to take it around say okay this is the garage
 this is the kitchen you have to teach it the lay out of your house yeah like the first thing you
 do it's it's named the always home cam it will cost 250 dollars and is slated to start shipping
 next year it is self-docking to allow it to recharge and it's able to fly around its owners home on
 pre-approved paths as you mentioned you know and it's supposed to allow homeowners to check to see
 if they left a window open forgot to turn the stove off or to check to make sure robbers aren't
 breaking in presumably you know because they're also billing it as a security feature
 and perhaps not surprisingly this announcement has been met with some mixed feelings yes
 Rick Holland the CISO and VP of strategy at digital shadows in an interview he told threat
 post for privacy advocates the concept of an untethered iot device surveilling the house
 is a little disturbing coupled with rings controversial privacy practices the adoption of
 the drone could be low however those that have already embraced the concept of in-house security
 cameras are likely to be excited the prospect of having a single drone monitor your house instead
 of multiple individual cameras would be alluring and this is exactly leases position is like hey
 instead of having you know cameras like steadily looking out into our various rooms you know this
 thing gives you total coverage potentially as long as it's you who are flying it around and
 looking at things because you know consider the idea of it getting taken over and someone in Russia
 taking a stroll around your house using this thing I mean really that's what's going to happen
 ring for its part said that they it has it is they built in privacy into the physical design
 noting that when the drone is docked in its charging base the camera is physically blocked
 you know the camera is down on this it's it's sort of a like a think of it as a as a big
 T shape where the top of the T is a big square so it's a square with a with a square post
 that drops down from the center of this the this T and the camera is down at the bottom of that
 so when this thing descends into its dock the post is going into a into a square shaped hole
 thus preventing this thing from seeing anything so it's clear that the camera cannot be seen
 but it's funny too because they said the device also has been designed to hum at a certain volume
 so it's clear that the camera is in motion and recording and I thought wait hum are you kidding
 me has anyone here not ever heard drones a micro drone fly I mean you you can't hear yourself think
 yeah you know generating the lift required using four tiny designer approved props because of
 course this thing has to look cute and and write and that requires that they spin at thousands of
 revolutions per minute at least I suppose we don't need to worry about the thing creeping up on anyone
 and surprising them and then what occurred to me is what I want to know is whether no one who designs
 and tests these things has a dog or cat at home because this thing would drive the pets insane
 yes it would you know they would dive under the bed and never be seen again you know
 flying down the hallway and thought about that oh my god wow what a what a wonderful year it has been
 well I really can't say that can't I it's been a terrible year 2020 maybe the worst year in living
 memory but it's been a great year getting together every week with my pal Steve Gibson I uh I've known
 Steve for oh my goodness it seems like more than 20 years I think it is and he's always been an
 inspiration he's always been fun to hang with and and what I really love about Steve and I'm sure
 you do too is he's super smart super analytical and he can really take tough complicated topics
 and break him down in a way that we can understand or at least have a shot at understanding I hope
 you enjoy security now I know I enjoy it we're gonna have to work on Steve because he says he's
 gonna stop at episode 999 and doesn't have room for a fourth digit I'm working on him don't worry
 but at least we know we have a good four more years with Steve Gibson and security now we'll be back
 next week with a brand new show Steve never rests uh but I'm wishing you now a happy and healthy
 holiday season please stay safe zoom your family if you need to see them but let's take care because
 the light is at the end of the tunnel and we'll all get together next week for security now see you then
