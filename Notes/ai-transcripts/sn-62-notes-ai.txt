 proxies security now is brought to you by a starrow makers of the starrow
 security gateway on the web at www dot a s t a r o dot com and by Dell for this
 week specials visit twit dot TV slash Dell it's time for security now our
 regular visit to the deep dark underside of the internet windows Mac and Linux
 Steve Gibson our security wizard is here from dot com Hi Steve but you know we
 at once again we're ahead of the curve last week talking about these windows
 exploits the zero day exploits that come out right after the first or the
 second Tuesday of the month yeah and there was another one a power point
 exploit fortunately which doesn't seem to be out in the wild it's just it's
 amazing when these patches come out there were 23 patches last Tuesday and boy
 they just the hackers get to work well and in fact I'm glad you brought that up
 because I wanted to reiterate that there is still this unpatched direct
 animation path control exploit that we talked about last week right it's it's
 Microsoft has not addressed it it's not clear whether or when they're going to
 and there is public exploit code in the wild I shot a note a note off to our to
 our friends down at Sunbelt software asking whether they had see whether
 their web spiders had encountered the active exploitation of this in the same
 way that it was like a wildfire with that VML the you know the right previous zero
 day I've not heard back from them yet but I do want to remind people that you
 know as we talked about last week if someone you know didn't get around to
 doing that the using the little zert utility to do to temporarily disable the
 handling of direct animation if in Internet Explorer if they use IE if they
 have scripting enabled by default then you really do I think it's worth just
 going and using this little bit of free software to turn that off until
 Microsoft patches and we we can assume it'll be in the second Tuesday of
 November that they will be patching so but that still leaves you know four
 weeks of open vulnerability window and you know the way things are developing
 now the the malicious hackers are deliberately releasing new exploits at
 the same time Microsoft patches to optimize or maximize the amount of
 vulnerability and it's all about installing junk in people's machines you
 know junk that no one wants installing yeah it's just it's just amazing and
 and the fact that Microsoft isn't responding to this pat this problem
 hysterectics problem surprises me frankly I guess they're still you know
 analyzing the issue yeah yeah and in fact and another interesting little bit of
 news is this too related I'm sure you probably picked up on some of this
 Leo the security companies have been very upset with Microsoft because
 Vista protects modifications of the kernel which which you know programs
 like McAfee and Symantec need to have access to the kernel in order to install
 their hooks well Microsoft Vista one of the new security enhancements is a you
 know explicit protection from making any modifications to the kernel the
 problem is you know from an antitrust standpoint this locks out third party
 software which has been able to use basically their own benign hacks in order
 to hack into the XP kernel to install themselves at the low level that they
 need to in order to monitor what's going on so what's real I kind of got a kick
 out of this is Microsoft said okay well yes we see that could be a problem
 so how about this in the service pack one release we will provide the API you
 know brand new API's my Microsoft apparently is just weeks away from from
 what's called RTM releasing to manufacturing that the final that the
 final version one over 25th it's one week away yeah yeah and so Microsoft is
 saying well there aren't API's in the kernel now that would allow this and so
 we can't put them in in time because I mean after all it takes Microsoft a
 month just a patch of flaw right so you know you could argue that there's no
 way you know they could delay Vista's release so it seems unfortunate that I
 mean essentially what's going to happen is as we know a major service pack
 release is typically you know 12 to 18 months downstream so none of these
 third-party tools can be developed in and and used until service pack one of
 Vista which means that basically they're gonna shut out the market for third
 parties now everyone will end up using Microsoft's new security solutions and
 tools which are Vista compatible and as a consequence of this it's very likely
 that you know these these traditional security companies are gonna you know
 not be able to hook in their tools and probably end up never achieving the
 market share that they would have if they've been able to release their stuff
 right at the at the at the release of Vista well you know it's complicated
 because you can if you can of course say well this is Microsoft trying to assert
 a competitive advantage but I have to think that given the trouble they've
 had with antitrust and the Department of Justice in the past that they'd be
 very unlikely to attempt that and they can make a pretty good argument well the
 reason we don't release you know what the reason we put this patch guard
 technology in is because it's not we're not just we're not worried about
 Symantec and McAfee we're worried about hackers and Lee having an API makes it
 open to hackers and I exactly I would rather Microsoft did not open it yeah
 because I think the danger of them doing that I mean you know the first question
 that pops up is okay wait a minute if you if there's an API anyone can use it
 the bad guys can use it too exactly I mean it's a win-win for Microsoft it
 both gives them a competitive advantage and it makes their system more secure by
 the way I'm just reading the article looks like that the API will only be for
 64-bit versions of Windows and anyway it won't be 32 bits so right and that's
 of course what the big money is is in the 32-bit version yes I think I think we're
 gonna see very slow adoption of 64-bit just because you know the hardware is
 not there you know although you could argue at the same time that Vista is so
 resource-hungry that we're gonna need a lot of all that ram I mean you know basically
 new machines anyway yeah although the 64-bit platforms are probably gonna be a
 lot more expensive than the you know the much more mature you know faster you
 know pending for machines now today on the show we're gonna talk about proxies
 and I want to do that in a second before we do I just this I mean this is kind of
 crazy but I just got an email this morning from Megan who has a kind of a
 crisis and I just wanted to ask if Spinrite would help with this I'm trying to
 help her out she apparently lost a folder within Outlook and it had a
 bunch of business emails that she absolutely needed I it's not clear from
 her email if she lost the entire Outlook.pst I think she did she says I
 didn't delete anything I didn't do anything is it first of all possible for
 a file just to disappear because of a hard drive error well yes it absolutely
 is. Would Spinrite recover a file if they were lost that way? Yeah probably if
 if the if the problem was some file system damage that was as a there was
 not created by a virus or malware that is deliberately rewriting something but
 if it was a sector which was no longer readable right then and for example we
 often see the you know the the testimonials pages full of people who were
 unable to get into Windows if they like it was an even boot loop they couldn't
 boot they couldn't do anything or something that they needed was broken and
 so so they just you know they ran Spinrite and almost by you know almost
 miraculously as they describe it now whatever problem they had is gone
 because it would the problem was a was a as a result of a low-level hard disk
 problem. So just to make it clear Spinrite isn't it doesn't understand file
 systems its file system independent it's not going to rebuild your table of
 contents but if the table of contents is damaged because of a bad sector or if a
 file is damaged because of a bad sector it can recover that data by by by recovering
 the data either moving it or kind of reformatting the sector underneath it to
 make it readable again. Is that right? Well that's that that's exactly right the
 way hard drives work today is different than the way they used to work. In the
 old days Spinrite had to understand the file system because it had to it had to
 relocate the clusters of data onto a different area of the drive and then
 relink the file system to refer to the relocated data. Today drives are doing
 sector reassignment and relocation themselves under underneath the file
 system. Is that part of the ECC process? Well yeah what what actually happens is
 that if you remember when when you and I demoed Spinrite on call for help we
 could see errors occurring all the time on drives. Hundreds of them every minute.
 Yes yes drives have gotten so dense that drives are now depending upon the error
 correction code ECC just to read good sectors. Not even bad sectors. You're
 really quantum level now where you're kind of guessing where the bits are
 whether they're on or off. These drives are so dense. I mean it's just
 insane how dense they are. I stopped buying big drives when you told me
 that I you know I buy Raptors because I like the 100 the 10,000 RPMs but I buy
 their 150 gigabytes. I don't buy the big drives anymore. It's funny because my
 computer supplier whenever I call about and need some drives I say okay what's
 the smallest. What's the smallest drive I can still buy. That's because you're
 trying to reduce aerial density and therefore make them more reliable. Yes
 okay yes. I mean you know you can imagine that today if we needed to we could
 create the most reliable hundred meg drive ever seen because you know by
 comparison the hundred meg drives the the individual bits were so huge on the
 drive there's no way current technology could not read them reliably but but
 you know manufacturers I mean think about it you know they're motivated by
 profit they want to cram as much data as they can and so drives are reliable
 enough you know they could you know they could make them absolutely reliable
 or you know well by by increasing the price or by lowering the density but
 but they you know they want five hundred gigabyte drives and we want them to be
 inexpensive cheap and so exactly so so they make them reliable enough so anyway
 but back to ECC real quickly what is what the drive does is when it makes a
 correction basically it creates an XOR mask and we've talked about XORing in
 the past in in the in the realm of encryption where you you you an XOR
 mask basically flips various bits so the error correction code what when there's
 a problem it creates an XOR mask that that inverts the wrong bits to make them
 right again well the length of the mask tells the drive how bad the sector is
 the longer the mask is from the first one bit to the last one bit which is to
 say the first bit that needs to be fixed and the last bit that needs to be fixed
 in a in in a linear run of bits the length of that tells the drive whether
 it's time to relocate this sector so drives can tolerate all and they do now
 routinely tolerate just all the time lots of little corrections when the
 correction starts getting too long it passes a certain threshold and the drive
 says oh if I wait much longer this may become uncorrectable and so the drive
 takes the sector out of service copies the corrected data to a new sector and
 and internally swaps that back into place since all that happens underneath the
 file system spin right doesn't need to worry about whether it's a Linux or a
 Tivo drive or a Mac or NTFS or anything it just works with the drive at the
 sector level to repair things and and spin rights magic is it's able to
 recover unrecoverable data that's always been its claim to fame and it's able to
 do much more than the drive can do by itself working with the drive so you
 know that's a long-winded answer to your your well what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
 send Megan an email saying you know get spin right I just wanted to verify with
 you my initial instinct which was it could be up fact that just a bad sector
 well and and you know for for for people like her who might be using spin right
 for a specific purpose you know we don't have a demo because there's a lot of
 people say I want a demo I've spent I know but so so what we do is we have you
 know no problem with someone buying it and trying it and then writing to our
 sales address and saying hey you know it didn't work for me I'd like I'm gonna
 destroy my copy I'd like my money back and so we just have no problem with that
 at all oh I had no idea you did that that's really
 have no no questions asked we'll just put the money back on your credit card
 Steve you're so ethical I can't stand it you're good I don't know how you've
 survived in this industry for as long as you that's because you know look look
 at that testimonials page you know if you were telling me about one guy who
 pirated it yes in fact we we got a piece of email last week he said corrects
 me I've got I've got in front of me said I must be honest and tell you I used a
 pirated copy of spin right a friend a friend of mine gave me because you
 never copy protected it I want to emphasize this he's never put copy
 protection on spin right no I mean I I would much rather trust our customers
 and not impede them in any way I mean you know good more and more more you know
 copy protection is becoming a problem anyway so he says a friend of mine gave
 me to recover 120 gig of data on a drive which suddenly quit as a systems admin
 by trade I should know better and backup regularly but you know how it is
 backups are always on a back burner not something we think about until problems
 occur he said needless to say spin right saved my bacon I was able to recover all
 my data yeah it to a secondary hard drive so great he says I was so thankful and
 happy I just bought my own licensed version of spin right thank you so much
 for an amazing product I doubt there very many people when there are many
 companies that could say that their pirated program worked and so people
 bought it I mean absolutely and and we hear this all the time I get this kind
 of mail and I mean so so I don't want to formally tell people they could you
 know loan their copies but if if if anyone listening to this owns a copy of
 spin right a friend of theirs is in trouble I'm not gonna have a problem if
 spin right could fix their system I would I would ask as a courtesy that that
 person then considers buying spin right if it works by it you know if it works
 for them yep you know I wish we'd had spin right at the data center where the
 website is a store because you know we had a drive failure over the weekend and
 it was everything I could do not to get on a plane with a copy of spin right
 and flight and flight of Dallas you know I don't think the techs there were
 paying much attention they didn't try to recover the drive they just pull it
 out but there was some bad sectors and Linux was booting read only because of
 it and and I thought boy if I can only get spin right on there I know I could
 save that drive that's the kind of thing it does all the time fortunately we had
 good backups and they gave me a free drive to replace it so it was okay although I
 have to say it took them so long I'm moving to a different data center and now
 I'm using RAID 5 with the three Raptors 350 gigabyte perfect and I think that
 will that will protect us yes yes in fact that that is exactly my
 configuration I'm not using Raptors because I don't need that much
 performance but on on GRC's web servers I use RAID 5 I have three drives
 three drives in a RAID 5 with a hot spare right and so the the RAID controller is
 able to to switch over and rebuild the the RAID array on the fly oh that's neat
 well I think I'd still have to make a call to the network center if that
 happened but at least we wouldn't lose anything and I backup you know we have
 a network attached storage device which I back up to and everything but right we
 didn't lose any data thank goodness anyway enough of enough the only reason I
 bring this up is because to get a chance to talk to Steve about hard drives I
 mean this is the guy who knows more about hard drives probably than any human
 alive except maybe Stanley Seagate or whatever but or Schugart died in the
 Al Schugart but yeah but so it's nice to get something in a while I ask the I
 have the privilege of asking you directly I do appreciate that you know as
 long as we're talking about security let me mention our longtime sponsor it's
 kind of need to be able to say our longtime sponsor and the great guys at
 Astarro Corporation AST ARO makers of the Astarro security gateway I've told you
 before that it's free for home users for non-commercial use you could download it
 from AST ARO.com put it on a you know beige box PC any old computer lying
 around and there it is boom you've got a great security device for a little bit
 more I think it's something like 80 euros a year you can add anti spam anti
 virus anti hacker all of this great stuff all open source all high quality I also
 want to tell you though that the Astarro security gateway appliance is designed
 for business if you're small or medium business network needs superior
 protection from spam viruses and hackers as well as complete VPN
 capabilities intrusion protection content filtering and an industrial
 strength firewall all in an easy to use high performance appliance contact Astarro
 AST ARO.com or call 877 the number four Astarro to schedule your free trial of an
 Astarro security gateway appliance in your business Astarro crowd sponsors of
 security now AST ARO.com today we're gonna talk about proxies yes we talked last
 week about Mojo Pack and I said that I wanted that the plan was this week to
 talk about Mojo Pack however unfortunately as I tried to communicate
 with them because as I said I wanted to really understand what the technology was
 I did a lot more research and I found out that that you know at the moment
 they're sort of in they've got problems from the looks of it they they jumped
 out of the gate prematurely there was a there was the the fall demo show was the
 weekend before the the podcast Expo that that's right that's right it's
 September 26th yeah yep and Mark Thompson was actually one of the of the 50
 companies that was chosen to show well the Mojo Pack company was another one as
 well as a third company called U3 I mentioned that because U3 has
 something very similar unfortunately the the Mojo Pack stuff has apparently had
 a lot of problems it was in beta working in a certain way when they took a
 diversion 1.0 they made a major change that that involves basically their own
 copy protection scheme it used to run on one on USB 1.0 drives which do not
 necessarily have to have a built-in serial number the spec for USB 2.0
 incorporates a serial number which locks their Mojo Pack stuff to the
 drive well so so what happened was people who are all excited about Mojo Pack in
 using it in beta when it went to version 1.0 it broke most of what people were
 doing without any announcement or word then when people started complaining they
 shut down the forums Mojo Pack shut down the forums in order not to allow these
 complaints to be seen study on how to do things wrong it was amazing and then
 then they had the the beta was also locked so that you could only use it for
 30 days that is the trial you can only use it for 30 days or 99 boots but it
 turns out the way people were using it they would boot it many times a day so it
 ended up lasting a week or two then it would refuse to work any longer but the
 e-commerce system was not online yet so people could not buy it and could not
 register it well a lot of that has just been fixed just in the last couple days
 I've been trying to get someone on the phone try I sent email I mean even to
 the to the who is registration email addresses because I can't get any
 response from anybody and so I just thought okay let's I'm gonna back off
 let's not talk about this product we can't we really I think it's not quite
 ready for prime time not ready yet and it does seem like there are problems
 with the technology because it doesn't perform a full virtualization of the
 system so people have been finding that registered software that locks itself
 to the computer won't it will see a different computer when you move it to a
 different environment well the whole idea is for it to be portable so you're
 able to you know stick it in any computer you happen to be visiting and it brings
 your environment with you well if you if you are relying on the programs that
 you've got and they suddenly say oh you're not authorized then you know defeats
 the purpose so anyway I'm I while doing all this I found another company called
 you three that has something similar and far more mature just appearing and they
 also announced and released at at the fall demo show and then there's another
 company called mocha five which is a an interesting really interesting approach
 coming out of Stanford anyway you know we've been talking about how virtualization
 technology is going to be moving forward well basically these are three net
 other virtualization solutions that I want to cover next week great because I'm
 very interested and obviously there's a lot of in demand for this kind of a
 product of course if it doesn't work it's not well I think it's a cool idea the
 idea that you carry your environment and your applications and your data with
 you you plug them in everybody wants this this is right windows well and of
 course it's been enabled by the fact that we now have affordable for gig USB
 flash drives you know it would it could you couldn't have done it back when
 people were talking about 64 megs right because contemporary applications and
 data won't fit there but now that you've got multiple gig flash drives it's like
 wait a minute this is this I mean it it inverts the whole model so I mean it
 it's very exciting and I and the other thing too is that the mojo pack guys
 really seem to be a little bit licensed heavy for example you you are you can
 move your mojo pack between drives I think twice and never again oh please I
 know I know why why and the problem is you know you would like and it's not
 cheap it's 20 29 95 now but it's gonna be 50 bucks after it comes out of it
 it's trial phase well that seems like a lot of money for what they're doing
 especially with all the limitations that they're there they're putting on it
 and it seems like a great idea so my sense is that they are not going to be
 alone in this market for long and there will like you know likely be some some
 free or open source solutions that that are coming along and in fact I've already
 pretty much found one oh good all right well we'll talk about all that next
 week yep this week proxies and you see this a lot I see proxies all the time you
 see it more often you know it's hidden away in the browser settings and every
 once in a while you'd see a program to say do you have a socks proxy or and then
 people who talked about proxy servers it doesn't seem like people talk about it
 much anymore what is a proxy and what is it used for well it is the kind of
 thing we want to talk about because it can be it can enhance your privacy and
 anonymity and and it can also be a security vulnerability and problem
 essentially stepping back and looking at a definition you know the word proxy
 itself implies somebody acting on your behalf so you know when you give like
 you know voting proxies to somebody else you're saying you know you have my
 voting proxy you can vote the way you know I instruct you to and so they do
 that on your behalf the the formal definition of for example an internet
 proxy or a web proxy is that your client for example your browser instead of
 connecting to the remote server it it connects to the proxy server it makes
 the request of the proxy which then turns around and on your behalf makes the
 request to the remote server the the result comes back to the proxy it then
 turns around and through the connection you have to the proxy it returns the
 data to you there are that this is actually being done by many ISPs and in
 fact my local Cox cable provider often proxies in a transparent fashion that is
 you you as a as a customer of the ISP you believe you're connecting to the
 remote machine in fact you are being transparently proxy that is it it's not
 a proxy that you even see or are aware of but you are you're actually connecting
 of your your connection is intercepted by the ISP it then makes the request the
 reason they do this is for caching the ISP naturally has to pay for all the
 bandwidth it uses out to the internet but if instead it can put a large caching
 proxy at its at its boundary to the internet then maybe some of the things
 your web browser is asking for are in its cache so so what happens is the first
 person for example to go to amazon.com will make a request for the Amazon page
 and due to you know the uniqueness of the page there are there are all kinds of
 you know it looks very cryptic if you look at one of these Amazon.com pages
 because they don't they don't want their page to be given to anybody else so so
 what happens is you make the request to amazon.com the proxy intercepts it gets
 the page from Amazon and then returns it to you as we know we've talked about how
 web pages are built that web page contains all kinds of other little
 pictures you know pictures of buttons pictures of of the user interface all
 kinds of other things which you your web browser then sends out in a series of
 requests well those are much more generic than the web page the custom web page
 you received so it's very likely that if anybody had anybody also behind the same
 proxy in this case an ISP's whole domain if if they had recently gone to Amazon
 and their browser had pulled all of those other things back through the proxy would
 cache them if it had permission to do so and keep them locally that's why that's
 that argument I have constantly with our advertising agency because their
 numbers are so low and I think it's a lot of it is because what would be the
 number one thing you would cash a podcast yes if a thousand Comcast customers all
 ask for the same security now podcast I bet you anything accounts as one
 download well and it it's good for two reasons first of all saves me bandwidth
 that's right well exactly it saves you bandwidth okay there's there's three
 reasons it saves you bandwidth it saves the ISP's bandwidth to the net
 remember that they're paying for their usage only get one copy exactly and it's
 one tattoo to the local customer that's the third advantage exactly Leo is that
 is that we're getting it from our local ISP even though it seems to be coming
 from AOL it's actually coming from us from a stored copy on our ISP is there
 anyway for my fast to tell that I'm getting a proxy to copy instead of a
 cached copy instead of the original copy there there is no way from the user
 standpoint in the case of a transparent proxy how about from the providers
 standpoint there actually is if they cared I care deeply it's interesting
 this is a problem that I had and solved with with shields up because that's how
 I happen to know that my my local Cox provider is using a transparent proxy
 because what would happen would be if if if someone at Cox for example went to
 shields up there they're using a web page that they think is coming from me but
 it's actually been intercepted by by by the Cox transparent proxy the IP address
 that I receive from on my web server is the proxies IP address not the local
 users exactly and so if I weren't you know a smart boy I would be testing the
 security of the proxy server exactly rather than the the the actual visitor
 who's coming to GRC to get their shields so you are able to get around that yes
 I do it two ways first of all SSL as we've talked about before is a key for
 avoiding proxies because unless the proxy is explicitly configured and and we'll
 talk about that in a second what what it means to have an explicit proxy as
 opposed to a transparent proxy but a transparent proxy cannot transparently
 intercept SSL because the certificate there's no way it can give your browser
 a certificate that matches the site so so when you establish a shields up
 connection the first thing I do is switch you into a secure SSL connection to
 avoid the proxy the other thing that happens is that proxy servers will add
 some headers to the request that they forward to the server which is
 another which is a nice way Leo that that your advertising technology could
 know that this was actually a request coming from a from a proxy and not from
 the user although it still wouldn't let the it wouldn't let we would just write
 we would know that the who's requesting this is not an end user but a proxy
 exactly but we would never know how many end users ended up sharing that copy
 that's true and there's no way to know that what happens is in a in a in an
 HTTP request there are headers at the beginning of the request that contain a
 bunch of different information like you know what the user's client is that's
 where cookies are offered along with the request the the user's user agent but
 one of the things an optional header that could be included says it's call
 it's it's an X header it says X hyphen forwarded for and then an IP address so
 that's where it's saying I am a proxy forwarding this request on behalf of this
 other IP so then you'd get the IP of the proxy server and the IP of the actual
 user behind the request in order to in order to see that that's what was going
 on there there there's another header called via and so that says that this
 is coming via you know this server so there are some headers that will expose
 that this is going on to the destination server but over on the user side there's
 no way for them to know well I'm gonna have to go send a note to our advertising
 agency and say are you looking for these headers well now now there are some
 other things that are going on that could be done in order to give you
 reliable counts remember at one point actually early in this discussion I said
 if the if the if the proxy has permission to cache the content so one way we know
 we can avoid caching is by using SSL SSL used to be much more expensive sort of
 in the old days of the net we would try not to use SSL because of the of the
 overhead of establishing connections that was especially true back in in the
 HTTP 1.0 days where you would establish a separate connection for every single
 asset that you were downloading from the server so that so you're just
 constantly establishing SSL connections that do have that crypto overhead at
 establishment well that's one of the reasons that the the next generation
 spec the HTTP 1.1 spec which is what virtually everyone is using today it
 limits the total number of connections by default to two so that your browser
 can establish two simultaneous connections to a server but now it will
 stream multiple queries and and responses through those two connections so that
 that dramatically lowers the per asset overhead of SSL because it creates the
 connection once and then leaves it up until the browser finally says okay I'm
 done with this server so it means that SSL is a far less overhead technology and
 also our machines at both ends the servers and the the the the client users
 machines are so much stronger now that SSL really doesn't represent an
 impediment so that's one thing that could be done the other thing is that when the
 server returns the request to the users client which may be intercepted by a
 transparent proxy one of the headers in the response is an expiration header or
 can be an expiration header and there are even cash prohibition headers it's
 possible for the server to say this expires in and it it can express it as a
 future time or a duration so basically and and and that's really what you'd
 like you'd like the server to say these gif images that I'm serving excuse me
 for the page have a lifetime of a day for example and so what that does is that
 permits not only the the transparent cash that the the proxy cash that may or
 may not be in line but that's something that the user's own browser pays
 attention to this is that this is where you sometimes see a difference if you
 refresh your page especially in at least for the IE if you hold a control key
 down when you do a refresh sometimes you'll get a different page or a fresher
 page what holding the control key down does is it says to IE do not use any
 assets in your cash go get fresh copy so shift so what are you on Mac okay yeah
 so so so the idea is that you know it's a benefit for users and for the server
 because the server says here's a page and oh by the way all these little you
 know page decoration things they're good for a day so as long as it hasn't been
 a day since you last asked for it feel free to use it from your local cash and
 that is your local browser cash and what that has the effect of is it it speeds
 up the second and third and successive pages on the same site as long as that
 the those pages are using the same assets your browser takes them from your own
 machine locally similarly any transparent cash is basically obeying the same
 rules it receives the assets and it will cash them for all of the users that might
 be behind the proxy served by the same ISP as long as that thing hasn't expired
 now the other thing that can be done for volatile content for example e-commerce
 pages you would hope that they're all going to be done over SSL so they're not
 going to have a problem but but you I've seen sites where where you're only secure
 during the the the sensitive transaction evolving a credit card and then you're
 no longer secure hopefully those pages are all marked as non-cashable there's a
 header that says absolutely never cash this the other thing that can be done
 and and sometimes it's done redundantly it's what I do on my own site is I show
 an expiration in 1997 who would actually a commonly used date in in the past that
 will also prevent anything from caching that content because it's like it's
 pre expired it says you know this expired in 1997 well now it's 2006 and so you
 know obviously that's no good so there are things that could be done to
 prevent these things from being cashed but but but you're right Leo there's no
 way to know if the content you're serving isn't pre expired or served so that it
 cannot be cashed it can be cashed and probably is being cashed because it's
 such a win for ISPs so I have to figure and I remember that at home kind of
 pioneered this that's one of the earliest broadband ISPs that was one of the
 things they were most proud of was this a cashed proxy servers and I bet you
 that we're missing a lot of downloads from the big broadband ISPs because I'm
 sure Cox Comcast Roadrunner they all do this yes I mean it it really is a win for
 them yeah okay now what we've talked about so far has been transparent ISP
 caching there's there's another type of proxy which is not transparent which is
 something that the user many users are often in a in a corporate setting they
 have to configure their browsers to use their their corporate proxy in order to
 get access to the web that's that setting in the browser that you see
 exactly and and here's an interesting tip once I went down to my office and I
 think it was in the evening because Sue was having some problems with her
 computer I fired up IE and waited for a long time I mean more than I'm used to
 for it to get going and I thought huh wonder what's going on well I poked
 around and I found that she had left IE set in its default case which is
 automatically determine proxy settings it turns out that if you haven't
 disabled that every time you launch IE you are hung for a while while IE looks
 for either a DHCP or a DNS server that can point it to a file containing its
 proxy settings so so for anyone listening who's an IE user you if you go
 through the normal menu you go to and under the tools off the main IE menu to
 internet options then choose the connections tab and then there at the
 bottom is a LAN settings button you should normally unless you need to use a
 proxy you should uncheck automatically determine the proxy settings if you do
 that I'm not sure if if you have to restart IE or reboot probably at least
 have to restart IE you'll be surprised how much faster Internet Explorer gets
 going because what the way these proxy settings are determined automatically is
 that Internet Explorer sends out a request to a DHCP server now we've talked
 about DHCP frequently because that's that the the it's what's engaged when you
 tell your system to obtain its IP settings well turns out the DHCP can
 actually provide a much wider range of information if it's asked to so beyond
 just my IP address my subnet mask and my gateway it's actually able to provide
 additional information and in fact in this case a URL for a server that can
 can give the browser a file telling it how to configure itself for for local
 proxy use that's cool I like that it is cool now the bad news is first of all
 this was all designed by Microsoft for IE in a in a 1999 draft you know an IETF an
 Internet engineering task force draft it has never been ratified it was never
 adopted it's expired I think it expired in 1999 I think it was actually older
 than that it expired it was never renewed and of course here we are now in 2006 so
 it never really took hold the problem is if if DHCP if no local DHCP server
 responds Microsoft IE falls back to using DNS queries it it it uses your machine
 name you know you within a corporate environment you might have like your
 machine name or number then you know dot your division dot your branch dot your
 company dot com for example and so what it does is it it looks for a specific DNS
 entry and it it goes backwards down the line stripping off one dotted name at a
 time until it gets all the way back down to your company dot com or or or
 graduate or whatever well so obviously that takes time which is where all this
 delay is coming from as we're waiting for IE to launch it always does that if
 you have it set to obtain the proxy settings automatically the problem is
 it it makes a mistake if you've got a more than a single name in your top level
 domain you know it works fine for you know grc.com or you know uci.edu for
 example it fails though with those URLs like co.uk it actually thinks that co
 is your company name it ends I know it's such a crock it's so easy to figure
 that one out and it ends up being a security problem because it makes a
 request out onto the internet for I think I think it's a file called W it's
 wpad.co.uk which because it thinks you're in you're at a company called co in the
 top-level domain UK right and it turns out that that file I mean that machine
 was created and it can give your browser bogus proxy settings causing it to
 reroute all of its traffic there oh interesting Microsoft yeah so you think
 they know a little bit about TLDs by now it's not that hard well it makes a
 mistake now now I'm not sure that the latest versions haven't fixed this who
 knows what's going on but it's definitely the case that anyone who
 doesn't need to use a locally configured proxy server definitely wants to go in
 and turn off that automatic proxy discovery technology it's bad in the
 first place and it slows down every time you use Internet Explorer and fire it up
 for the first time so so what this does essentially is it gives your browser a
 URL and a port often it's it's like port 8080 that is used internally and all of
 your browsers traffic is rerouted through your your company's local
 proxy server now that has a number of different benefits you know which which
 really can be useful and and and and enhance the experience for example it can
 be doing caching it will often often be enforcing policies you might have your
 corporate IT you know black listing a whole bunch of sites that they don't
 want anyone going to so it allows them to perform filtering it also allows them
 to to perform you know on the fly malware filtering so that you're not
 going to be getting malicious scripts and and and code and things by by forcing
 the browser to go through this locally configured proxy so it can be that this
 stuff is being done transparently but more often in a corporate setting you'll
 find that you know if you don't use their local proxy they've got port 80 blocked
 at the at the corporate firewall so you're not able to get out and access a
 server on port 80 you are forced to configure your browser to use your
 employer's proxy which in the process of doing so means that all of your traffic
 goes through their filter for you know whatever purposes and unfortunately it
 does mean that you know there are privacy concerns right right right so what
 should you do really you have no choice at that point you you could as and we
 sort of talked about this you could use you know like a hamachi or go to my PC
 or VPN title right you know in order to get out of the corporate shield and of
 course you know then there's a problem if if your corporation is allowing that
 that's controversial because then you are explicitly avoiding whatever you
 know security policies they've put in place for the purpose of protecting
 themselves right right so that's that you know that's of dubious value and you
 know you could you could imagine people in the future are going to be you know
 blocking these sorts of things because you know it does open holes through the
 through the corporate security right right and finally there are other
 proxies I mean just sort of in general there are for example compression
 proxies which cell phones and PDAs are beginning to use more and more they will
 connect through a proxy and its job is to reformat large pages to fit much
 smaller screen sizes so there you're actually seeing you know content being
 redesigned on the fly in order to in order to to fulfill some specific niche
 need of of that proxy user and so I mean the the whole concept of a proxy is
 something which is is in between you and your your remote connection and is
 probably doing some sort of filtering function that there's even a very
 popular local proxy that you actually run in your own machine called Proxamatron
 Proxamatron oh yeah we've recommended that for years yeah I mean it's a it's a
 terrific looking piece of software I've ever seen but it does get a job done
 yes it is it's not it's extremely techy and not very user friendly but the idea
 is it sets up a little local web server on your machine you configure your web
 browser to use it as you know your own machine as the proxy server so you you
 make your request to Proxamatron just like we were saying and it issues the
 request from itself in your computer it comes back that allows it to impose
 itself in between your browser and the outside world and perform whatever
 filtering and you know anti spam anti advertising all the different things
 that it's able to do on behalf of of of your system that raises an interesting
 question what kind of performance hit do these proxy servers impose well now
 that's a very good that's a very good point Leo so the certainly the the fancier
 they are the more they're doing the the more performance penalty you're going to
 have and and a simple caching server is very low overhead you know the the the
 instance of a caching server on the ISP has as we've said due to the fact that
 it will often have substantial amounts of content that are current in its cash
 due to somebody else having recently gone to MSNBC or MSN or Amazon or eBay or
 whatever I mean the the net benefit is a huge gain because you're not loading
 down that remote server that the the destination server and you're getting
 your content back on essentially what is a land you know your own ISP's land so
 that's a big improvement that's a concept everything yes and and and also
 like I'm a try might slow it down because yes and and also proxamatron is very
 powerful in as much as it's using it's using regular expressions it's using
 scripting it it's got typically lots of layers of things one of the one of the
 things that I've talked about and just have never never gotten around to is is
 this notion of a of GRC's net filter which would be a transparent filter to do
 these sorts of things but of course I'd write it in assembly language and you
 know I'd really efficient make it really efficient and way prettier and and more
 user-friendly so it's on my on my list of things I hope to get around to one of
 these days someday I know it's a long list folks it's a little growing list and
 long and growing and lastly I'm going to reserve a an in-depth look at one
 additional proxy system for its own entire episode because it's so cool many
 people are interested in it and are talking about it and that's Tor the onion
 router system lots of questions about Tor yes it it yeah it's really cool
 technology I want to give it its own show because it deserves it and it's
 basically it uses a chain of explicitly privacy enhancing proxies in a very
 clever way using essentially nested encryption in a in a that create the
 reason it's called an onion router is it's like layers of an onion right which
 are wrapped and unwrapped and we've got all of the background from our from our
 from our crypto series to understand the use its use of symmetric and asymmetric
 crypto keys I mean it's just been beautifully designed so we're going to
 talk about that here before long in a couple weeks good well we made this an
 extra long episode because I slowed you down at the beginning but I'm glad we
 talked a little bit about proxies I know people are very interested in that and
 we've seen that that word around for a long time and there are all different
 kinds of proxies some could be an advantage some could be a security issue
 and it just depends on how it's being implemented I guess there actually have
 been cases where proxies have by mistake they have cashed malicious pages wow and
 so after the server was taken down the the the server's content had been
 scattered all over the net in ISP transparent caching proxies which
 continued to infect people systems well and in fact there have been search
 engines that have been guilty of the same thing since since search engines
 cache you know basically you know Google I don't mean to single out Google because
 all search engines do this but or they the ones that are doing caching do they
 will keep copies of pages they don't know that it's a malicious page but they'll
 keep it in their local cash and if you ask they'll they'll you know surf it to
 you it's there yep yeah although I would imagine certainly in this day and age
 that Google would spend some effort trying to sanitize that stuff well of
 course as we know Google it Google is now explicitly using a list of known
 malicious pages and warning people if they click on a link I actually got that
 warning a couple days ago when I was when I was poking around really um yeah
 it'll it'll say this is a potentially malicious page are you sure you want to
 view it oh that's really interesting really a cool service that's a good idea
 all right Steve Arino I appreciate your time as always we remind people that
 spin right is the ultimate disk recovery and maintenance utility and available
 from Steve's site at grc.com we also thank the folks at Dell for providing the
 support for this podcast they've been a great sponsor for the last couple of
 months and every week we add new pics to the Leo's pics page at twit.tv/dell if
 you're getting ready for Vista you're ready to buy a new computer you just
 like to see what's out there in terms of laptops and desktops we've got laptops
 and desktops and other things all on the page and we'd appreciate it if even
 if you don't buy those items if you click through there we get credit for
 anything else you do buy at twit.tv/dell thanks to Dell for their support
 Steve Gibson I think we've wrapped up another thrilling gripping episode of
 security now we're gonna call it security and hard drive maintenance now
 new name for the show I'm so I apologize for bringing that stuff up I just you
 know when I get when I can have you to ask questions it really is a valuable
 opportunity for me and I know people are interested in these subjects so yeah I've
 actually had people want to spend more time talking about spin right which I
 mean I I want to keep it in people's mind even just just how drives work would be
 of interest that's not security but you you know so much I'm sure in order to
 write spin right you had to really learn the details of drive operation right
 down it's nitty gritty it's my life is it you know is it it sounds like it's
 changed a little bit since when you first started writing spin right oh yeah I
 mean remember that that you know the the original catalyst for spin right was
 interleave optimization oh yes I remember that you said the interleave size when
 you first formatted a drive oh those dark days are gone thank good the the
 original concept was to do a non-destructive low-level reform matter
 no one no one had ever heard of it and in fact when when Peter Norton invited me
 up to Santa Monica because he wanted to buy spin right from me he said you know
 Steve you know of course he was famous for the Norton utilities right and and
 yeah their own reviews their their surveys of what their customer want
 their their customers of the Norton utilities wanted they said they wanted
 spin right and so he had me up for lunch to you know what's it gonna cost to buy
 spin right from you and of course not selling it to Peter was the best
 decision I ever made in my life I mean literally but that's true why is that oh
 because you know it that was that was in the early days of spin right and I I've
 been you know basically thriving from spin right and spin right's been thriving
 from me you know for all these years if I had sold it to them I wouldn't I
 wouldn't have it but then neither would they actually they ended up cloning it
 and I'm being polite because I know this is not Peter's fault but we found our
 code in their version which they called calibrate after I declined to sell it
 I remember calibrate yeah calibrate but it ended up we ended up winning from that
 too because since they hadn't really written it they couldn't support it and
 so their customers would call and their own support people ended up saying well
 why don't you just get a copy of spin right that's what we stole it from
 anyway so we ended up getting referrals from them oh that's but but but but Peter
 said he said you know Steve when I heard that you were doing a non-destructive
 low-level reformat he said I just shook my head and kept waiting to see a mushroom
 cloud coming up from from you know south of me in Southern California he said
 you know how could you possibly do that safely and I said well that's you know
 that's my magic so of course the mushroom cloud eventually came from the
 other side of the valley but that's another story entirely for another day
 Steve gives in a pleasure as always GRC.com for show notes the 16 kilobit
 versions and of course Elaine's great transcripts grc.com and we will see you
 next Thursday and maybe we'll talk about mojo pack and the like yeah you know
 equivalent software and next Thursday on security now thanks Steve take care
