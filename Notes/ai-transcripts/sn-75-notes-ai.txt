 Netcast you love from people you trust this is Twitter bandwidth for security now is provided
 by AOL radio at AOL dot com slash podcasting this is security now with Steve Gibson
 episode 75 for January 18 2007 Vista DRM security now is brought to you by a
 staro makers of the star security gateway on the web at www dot a s t a r o dot com
 Steve Gibson laboring away at his lab of security at g r c dot com has come up with fortress
 of solitude your fortress of solitude has come up with yet another great application
 a secure but we're going to talk about that because it's it's it's time it's time but
 before we get to that Steve let's say I I don't know I hope a lot of people heard last
 weeks episode and if you didn't I almost want to say pause the iPod and go back to 73 because
 old Leo dude I mean don't almost say it absolutely say it because you know I do want
 to continue on the topic a little bit more I was sort of you know I really wanted to give
 Peter a chance to to explain things and I really think he did there were some points
 that I was sort of trying to slip in that I want to make sure got made because there
 is so much hysteria now and even mainstream articles that I'm seeing are wrong about what
 they're saying Vista DRM is so so absolutely let's assume that anyone listening to this
 has listened to last week's interview with Peter because you know it was really fantastic
 he's I think he made such a good case you know and I've read various critiques on the
 web and stuff and in general I think they've completely missed his point and just to just
 to recap I think one of the most significant points is well you could say Hollywood required
 this but nobody made Microsoft build this into all versions of Vista and in in the last
 analysis that doesn't seem like a very good decision I mean I think Linux and I hope Apple
 will say you know this should be separate this should be in a box you know I think that's
 why Apple did this Apple TV yeah it should be external to the computer you shouldn't
 hobble everyone with his premium content copy protection well and and you might suggest
 for example that there would be a Vista media center edition in the same way that we had
 that with XP the reason it's not feasible is that this stuff is literally down in the
 kernel right it it required so much change to Vista that they weren't really they weren't
 practically able to do a DR a Vista DRM and and well actually that sort of brings up another
 point too is that as I've been reading again I feel like for the fifth time I've read the
 Microsoft specs I'm sure it takes five readings to be honest with you the stuff's complicated
 and it's inner it's there's a lot of interaction among these components but it's another issue
 that's more clear to me now is that what they've done is basically created a a heavily
 DRMed OS that is it's not just for protecting HD it may have been it may have been driven
 by their interest in doing that but they make a point in some of their papers that you know
 there's been a lot of DRM that's had to be installed by third parties on prior versions
 of Windows because Windows didn't itself have a deep enough native digital content management
 system to to satisfy everyone well that's really been fixed in Vista so so they didn't
 want to just have for example a media laden version that had all this stuff they really
 want Vista to be a a digital rights management platform that that other non-Hollywood non-AACS
 high-def video content users can now rely on for protecting whatever it is that they
 want to put DRM on so I mean it brings all that along too.
 One of the things I guess we wanted to do in this episode is kind of circle back and
 talk about some of the things that we didn't either didn't raise in 73 or maybe weren't
 completely clear yeah exactly and I have actually gotten my before we do that can I
 just get the commercial in oh yeah please all right I hate to tease people but but I really
 do want to mention that a star is supporting this podcast because they've been so great
 they're back again this year and they are a wonderful product which we can really stand
 behind that's that's kind of the reason that we were so glad to get them back for 2007 and
 they're supporting security now yeah if it yeah exactly you know Steve asked me before
 we went on there now we're gonna keep doing this for a while I said hey as long as the
 star keeps paying for it absolutely this right now is the only Twitter podcast with a sponsor
 and that's that makes you golden Steven though we thank a star makers of the historic security
 gateway I have one and I am blown away by it it's great quality I mean thing is rock
 solid if you if you're a smaller medium business and your network needs superior protection
 from spam I mean listen to what it does this is one box looks like a router about the size
 of router but it's but it's so much more it does spam anti spam anti virus a content filtering
 of course it's an industrial strength firewall so protects against hackers it has intrusion
 detection built in it's a complete VPN server that's what I've been using it for which is
 fantastic I mean use all of the features but it and it's all in one easy to use high performance
 appliance now you can try it absolutely free in your business visit a s t a r o dot com
 or call eight seven seven the number four a s t a r o make sure if you do that that you
 mentioned that you heard it on security now and by the way I also want to recommend it
 for non commercial users you can download the software for free if you decide you like it
 you can get all those additional subscription features like anti spam and content filtering
 for a very low yearly cost much less than you're probably paying for the software versions
 of these programs a s t a r o dot com and we thank them for their support all right let's
 I'm sorry I didn't mean to interrupt there I just wanted to get that done and oh no no
 problem let's get back here I'm holding the out can't the output content protection and
 windows Vista document written by Microsoft okay in my hand and before the show I went
 through during my fifth reading of this thing and just highlighted some some sections that
 I want to read verbatim so that so that it's sort of like on the record and we can talk
 about these things for example in the introduction Microsoft says and I'm just reading from their
 document we are working actively to ensure that a Windows Vista PC supports the needs
 of both consumers and content owners and that it works seamlessly across a broad range of
 other devices networks and protocols as we move towards the next evolution in the distribution
 and consumption of content we are working on many fronts to create new experiences that
 drive the industry forward this requires the ability to respect business rules across
 many dimensions including content coming into a PC from cable satellite over the internet
 or on a physical media such as next generation DVDs management of the content on the PC including
 providing a robust infrastructure that allows ISVs to add value without needing to worry
 about supporting DRM natively in their own applications and respecting business rules
 as content leaves the PC this paper talks about one aspect of the content protection
 work it addresses increasing the security associated with video and audio rendering
 on the Windows Vista PC platform that's the key is video and audio rendering I mean it
 doesn't impact other stuff generally actually it does and in some drive and put a good light
 on the side I know well but no but in some good ways I mean one of the one of the things
 that I've been distressed about over the last two weeks and our two episodes is that many
 people are swearing off Vista they're saying oh I'm never going to go to that thing because
 I don't want to be burdened with all this I don't want all of the scary things that Peter
 was talking about to be in the machine I own I'm distressed because as we have said in looking
 at Vista security previous to this there are many good things that Vista is doing I mean
 you know Paul has become Paul Therat has become a fan of Vista by using it I'm running it
 on on one of my tablet PCs and in fact in in last week's episode you were asking Paul
 about Vista on it on a tablet I mean they've done beautiful things and it's going to be
 installed on all the machines that people are buying next month so I mean it's clearly
 going to happen so so I'm I'm distressed by the fact that you know there there is no way
 around the fact that it that Vista is also a pervasive digital rights management platform
 I mean we're getting a lot of good from a security standpoint and the content providers
 are getting a lot of good for their own security yeah which sometimes exactly which sometimes
 runs against the freedom and flexibility that mean that even honest users of content would
 like to have I I appreciate the fact that I can buy DVDs and I can recompress the content
 and watch them on my PDA while I'm flying you know flying around the country I mean it's
 really useful to be able to do those things I'm willing to give that up I just think that
 the content protection should be stuck in a DVD player or an external box in some way
 outside the computer so that we can still have our general purpose flexible computers
 the real problem is that the content industry sees any personal computer is a threat because
 any personal computer can be used to crack stuff well that's the end there they would
 like to make sure that all personal computers of any stripe including Linux computers have
 this kind of protection and to protect speaking speaking of which I I received last week a
 the second generation Toshiba HD DVD player that's the the the HD a2 which is there you
 know it's I had that order until LG announced the dual format so I'm waiting to see what
 the dual form cuz then I'm thinking well maybe I should buy although I like HD DVD but maybe
 I should just buy the dual format well and if Apple's gonna go Blu-ray there's another
 strong driver of the Blu-ray format and HP will but so you got this new standalone player
 and I just out of curiosity I mean this thing is phenomenal it's got it's got network configuration
 in it because there's an ethernet connection and you can configure it for DHCP or give
 it a fixed IP just like a PC which is for it to enable it to update its firmware in case
 you know bugs are found in it or things need to be changed so I was curious about you know
 what's in this thing so I flip to the back of the manual under the license information
 and get a load of the things that are covered by the license Linux kernel yeah busy box
 G live see open SSL open source software yes it is completely built on Linux and open
 source software you know my my Panasonic TV also has the GPL in the back of the manual
 because it's got Linux and open SSL open SSH in it that's so funny and so so they they've
 used a lot of open source software but of course there are pack open source software
 and put it in your box just don't modify my Linux that's all I care about exactly okay
 so you made a really good point last week that open the success and the strength and
 the power of the personal computer platform has always been because it is an open platform
 well you can do things like that yes and get a load of this again reading from Microsoft's
 document they even say that they say a consumer electronics device is a closed box users can't
 load software onto it or add cards to capture content at least that is the current perception
 of premium content providers though it might not be true for future CE devices by contrast
 the Windows based PC is designed to be an open platform anyone can load software on it
 unfortunately you know malware authors can too it's easy to write that's not in the Microsoft
 document by the way I didn't think so I sounded pretty parenthetical okay sorry about that
 anyone can load software on it it is easy to write software for it because all the interfaces
 are well defined and published and there are many good software tools available the PC buses
 are also well defined and anyone can design cards to plug into these buses continuing to
 read from the document the openness of the hardware platform is essential to a vibrant
 PC ecosystem in the current world however the industry is also working to prevent hackers
 from using that openness to pirate copyrighted content the goal is to make the Windows based
 PC a safer place for premium content so that content providers will be happy to allow Windows
 base PCs to play their content the term quote premium content unquote is used in this paper
 to refer to valuable content that needs to be protected from stealing each content type
 has its own particular policy that defines what the user can and cannot do with it the
 term quote high level premium content unquote is used to refer to the most valuable content
 types such as high definition DVD and Blu-ray DVD the content industry may introduce robustness
 rules and testing that would effectively lock out PCs from premium content by not allowing
 PCs a license key for the encryption system used by conventional access system I'm sorry
 by conditional access systems or HD DVD and Blu-ray DVD these productions these protection
 schemes will be very strong huh baby in the it doesn't say that either very strong in
 the future though don't you baby based on AES advanced encryption standard RSA and so on
 under these future rules a PC would only be granted a license to play the content if it
 is at least as secure as consumer elect as a consumer electronics appliance to make the
 PC safer for premium content safer my safer I know has been working with members of the
 PC industry to solve the technical issues in hardware and software our key partners in
 this work have been Intel ATI Nvidia S3 and Matrox while preserving the general openness
 of the this doesn't say that either of the PC platform of the PC hardware platform new
 solutions must be able to resist attacks against protected content these solutions must also
 preserve the windows experience for legitimate users particularly without jeopardizing their
 privacy so so that's sort of yeah that sounds very good but it does but really I have to
 say I don't know if that goal is possible that I to me the question comes down to what
 is your personal computer an open platform or consumer electronics device well exactly
 and so then this starts getting more specific they have it's there's an acronym soup of course
 once again they have something called p v p dash o p m p v p stands for the protected video
 path o p m stands for output protection management and Microsoft's document says typically p v p
 o p m operates within the windows vista protected environment and enjoys the software protection
 this provides the protected environment checks for any unsafe situations for high level premium
 content and turns off playing the content if an unsafe condition is found it says to work
 with p v p o p m a graphics card manufacturer must provide for the following one output protection
 management capability on all board outputs at a minimum provide the ability to turn off
 every output to device driver capability to report reliably about the out board outputs
 and their settings three h d c p which we know is hot high def content protection or no yeah
 uh these acronyms are amazing it's amazing you can keep them straight for d v i and h d m
 i outputs and macro vision and c g m s hyphen a protection uh on analog t v outputs otherwise
 outputs will be turned off by the p v p o p m software and finally the ability to pass video
 through a constrictor that is a downscaler followed by an upscaler so that the information
 content of premium video can be reduced when an unprotected output such as analog vga is
 present so you know so these are the things that paul did the peter was was referring
 to but to do this requires closing down to a to a great degree the previously open architecture
 it says the graphics hardware manufacturer must do whatever is appropriate to prove that
 the driver is talking to genuine hardware if a particular implementation proves to be
 insufficient as highlighted by a hack or a valid complaint from content owners so now
 content owners are able to complain yeah get this this is microsoft's document then the
 related driver might need to be revoked that's the thing that bugs me yes go ahead and a new
 driver would have to be deployed with additional h f s tests so all of a sudden your computer
 could stop working yes yes your video driver could be revoked i mean it it's it and mean
 and they and as Peter pointed out that could happen just because they stopped paying their
 fee yes it's merely you know if the company went out of business it could be revoked
 right um here in the document uh here in the document under this uh h f s and drivers supporting
 multiple chips they they talk about the risk of a single driver supporting multiple chips
 because if that driver were revoked it could affect much more than a single chip vulnerability
 and literally again reading from the document it says the windows vista protected environment
 will after due process revoke any driver that is found to be leaking premium content
 in uh huh either itself or from the hardware it controls if the same driver is used for
 all the manufacturers chip designs then a revocation could cause all that that company's products
 to need a new driver and Peter pointed that out in his article that these unified drivers
 are going to disappear was nice you go to nvidia download one file would work on any
 nvidia card but that's not going to happen anymore right and that of course does substantially
 increase the cost which ultimately gets passed on to the end user which is of course then
 the real it the real reason that he was talking about the cost of vista drm um on this issue
 of tilt bits it says micro sauce document reads tilt bits are provided in the ddi that's
 the device driver interface as the drivers mechanism for reporting that a hacker is suspected
 if at any time the graphics driver determines that something improper has happened then
 it can set the appropriate tilt bit for example if the hash of an output status message doesn't
 mass match the message if any tilt bit gets set then windows vista will initiate a full
 reset of the graphic subsystem so everything will restart including re-authentication the
 tilt bits are also used by the driver in the p v p u a b that's the that's another one of
 these acronyms u a b is the user accessible bus that is to say if you had a separate graphics
 card rather than integrated graphics on the motherboard where the where vista goes really
 ah well then I can't say they go overboard but vista is very concerned about any non-encrypted
 I mean the whole idea is not to allow any exposed non-encrypted content anywhere from
 literally from soup to nuts from from original content all the way to your eyeball I mean
 if they could pretend if they could encrypt somehow did the audio that I put in your brain
 exactly tcp in there too because they're worried about someone you know literally using a digital
 video camera against the screen that will be we'll talk about that nature in the 2021
 edition of security now so they say there is no requirement regarding the circumstances
 under which a driver should set a tilt bit adopting this mechanism is another example
 of the hardware manufacturer showing their intent to properly protect premium content
 yeah it was another thing that he talked about is this notion of intent yeah yep that's really
 what they want you to do it's not merely that you've the fact the spec isn't that clearly
 written it they just want to have you prove that you care well and it really sounds like
 as I've read this again and again and again it sounds like they're trying Microsoft is
 trying to help to prevent lawsuits against content leakers interesting and so the more
 intent a hardware provider demonstrates the better their case will be against the against
 the industry that brings a suit against them for allowing for allowing their subsystem of
 windows to leak content so this no I mean that that's where this showing intent is coming
 from is is you know because it actually says in this document it talks about about not
 not doing a sufficient job and and the and the the kinds of of onus that the the hardware
 maker or software driver author could be subjected to and then under this issue of resolution
 constriction this document Microsoft document says in the future some types of premium content
 through its content policy will specify that a full resolution analog VGA output is not
 allowed oh boy and uh-huh and that the resolution must be reduced it is not practical to change
 the actual scanning rate of the display particularly because some displays are fixed resolution
 but what is important is that the information content of the signal is reduced to the resolution
 specified by the content owner I just want to shoot them now I just and here's the line
 basically a high resolution picture needs to be degraded to make it soft and fuzzy now
 that's just for premium content although it sounds like if they're saying it has to happen
 over the VGA does that mean if it's just my windows desktop it's soft and fuzzy well
 okay now this is let me see if I was through here because there this is a great there's
 a great point that you're making um oh there's there's one more thing here we'll get on that
 okay this is under content industry agreement hardware robustness rules and then this just
 again for anyone who's used to the open platform paradigm that that the P the created the PC
 this reads content industry agreement robe content industry agreement robustness rules
 sir refer to uh-huh salute refer to among other things how how a hardware manufacturer
 lays out and generally implements circuit boards the rules are determined by the content
 industry in discussion with implementers and are described in for example the 5c DTCP and
 AACS documents which are referred to in this paper as content industry agreement documents
 that's the problem not an engineer now huh a bunch of lawyers who yes thing the intent
 of the hardware robustness rules is to make it very difficult for hackers to use the graphics
 card or motherboard to extract video data interpretation is required all of this interpretation is
 required for some of these documents and it is sometimes difficult to determine conclusively
 what is allowed interpretation simultaneous translation work and out loud it's a foreign
 language content in that that yes Microsoft says content industry agreement hardware robustness
 rules must be interpreted by the graphics hardware manufacturer vendors should work to
 ensure that their implementation will not be revoked for playback of a high level premium
 content as the result of a valid complaint from the content owners so we can't tell you
 what they might complain about but you just better be sure you don't get a complaint and
 finally if it is found for example reported by reported by Hollywood that a graphics chip
 manufacturer is allowing quote hacker friendly unquote cards to be manufactured and their
 chips and with their chips and if that chip manufacturer is unwilling or unable to stop
 those cards being manufactured then the final recourse would be the revocation of the driver
 for that chip and I want to make you clear that means they can reach into a Vista PC remotely
 and make that video card stop working yes I mean it's not like from now on all cards sold
 that means my system right now how would they revoke that is it done in windows update oh
 absolutely it would be done through Vista updating its license keys which it has to do
 or you can't use it well that's exactly right the graphics manufacturer the graphics card
 manufacturers have keys and they are entirely revocable at basically at anyone's whim anyone
 who's able to demonstrate that the card is leaking content would now hopefully it could
 be fixed in the driver so so the idea would be windows update would update your driver
 and again driver updating is then no longer something you could voluntarily choose to do
 or not do you would update your driver or suffer revocation the idea being that it would update
 the driver the driver would have new keys and the old keys would would then be revoked
 so that so no one who did not update their driver would then be able to play the content
 the idea being the industry wants to to retroactively be able to go out and fix any mistakes in
 software or hardware and the problem of course is you know that model says we could fix it
 in software if in fact a a highly a highly popular card were found to be hackable so that
 content could get out of it digital content could be recorded from it then at the discretion
 of the content providers they could require that that card that is to say all cards of
 that hardware no longer be able to pre to play premium content I mean it's it is complete
 they could it's come the card would still work on the computer I just couldn't play
 a DVD back correct oh oh okay I was a little scared I thought the card driver would stop
 working in its entirety no and and that brings us back to that point that I referred to as
 this as as an important segue just before we started talking about this last bit and
 that is it is extremely important to recognize that all of this is controlled by content
 policy on I mean that is that is bound to cryptographically signed to the digitally protected
 content so it is a function of what the provider chooses to do so so so the idea is that that
 yeah I just watched my screwed is what the idea is I'm really but I do want to score
 that because I think I misunderstood it I sounded like the thing the whole thing would
 stop working I'll still be able to use my PC in every normal respect but I just won't
 be able to watch a hide fdvd yes the and and and that's what I was sure that's true yes
 we're absolutely sure and I'm less up perturbed then because I never put an HD DVD in my computer
 I'm gonna watch it on my TV well it's why I wanted to make this point why I was so important
 to make this point is that even today as far as we know current versions of HD DVDs are
 allowing full resolution output from component video they haven't yet it's kind of enabled
 this bit well well yes there the policy that is bound to the digital content is not saying
 disable component now for example my HD DVD player this brand new Toshiba that I got last
 week it's got HDMI digital output and component video so I mean and component video has been
 around for years many many consumer devices and projector you know home theater projectors
 and so forth have component video and may not have the newer digital interface so you
 can imagine that it would be very distressing for somebody who purchased this brand new
 Toshiba HD DVD player and was watching HD DVDs to find one that simply refused to play through
 their component outputs right so so it's not clear that this is ever actually going to
 happen which is one of the things I wanted to make clear this is well and this is this
 is where I know I this is where so much of the confusion has come from it is absolutely
 the case that it is possible for this to happen but we don't know so far hasn't agreed to
 do hasn't decided to do that yes and and even revocation it you could argue that that killing
 off hundreds of thousands of in the field working video cards is really I mean it's
 such a such a bad thing you really have to wonder if the if the content providing industry
 would choose to do so they absolutely have the ability but that doesn't mean they're
 going to yeah well I you know I don't blame them for wanting to preserve the right to
 do so or kind of build it into the hardware I just hate the fact that we're just kind
 of they can hold that over our heads yes so your point is don't avoid Vista merely because
 of this the the security advantages are so great that you you probably do want to want
 to go with Vista yes I I mean well okay in laptops for example many people are buying
 laptops there's an integrated system with on card video it seems to me laptops are more
 often to be some something where you could imagine in the next generation watching movies
 then then then you know your Vista machine in front of your you know where you're normally
 doing work so a laptop could make a very useful content delivery platform and and it would
 be protected it'll be running Vista and you can watch HD DVD videos on it probably without
 any problem I I really hope that all of this doesn't destabilize Vista which was a really
 strong point that Peter made we're hearing anecdotal reports all over the place that
 Vista seems flaky that and somebody yesterday said it doesn't play video games very well
 he was trying to play direct X9 games and they would frequently freeze or die now we
 still don't know why that is could be a lot of reasons and there have been reports again
 anecdotal reports from from people who are having problems with Vista currently playing
 movies of various sorts depending upon what type of connectors they have we know yeah
 I think on a high high def content a lot of times will not play though the now there
 are I want to wrap up by talking about interfaces because the last the the so-called last mile
 in Vista is from the output of the box to your display device there is there are there
 are analog technologies which are not protectable IE composite and that's that hold that they
 were talking about exactly and even even component video is an analog technology now
 Vista will apparently add macro vision and and various types of copy protection to that
 and compliant recorders will refuse to record that content if they see those protection measures
 have have been stuck in the the two types of video interfaces are DVI and HDMI both of
 those are able to to carry HDCP the high def content protection which which basically allows
 the authentication of your display device itself back to the computer so what I would
 urge people to do in the future is when you if you are buying screens and displays that
 you want to be future proof make sure they do provide HDCP either with a DVI connector
 a digital video interface connector or the HDMI but even farther than that because we've
 seen some displays that have HDMI but don't have HDCP that's true and those you will not
 be able to play back high def content in fact that was part of the problem is that all of
 these quote HDCP capable cards sold up to now are not right and I and and well because
 and well and yeah about nine things I wanted to say right there again I don't think it's
 that it won't play it but it won't play it crisp it will deliberately it'll run it through
 yes it will not play it but it's supposed to downscale it you know yes it'll run through
 the the constrictor and again the content provider in the policy that comes with the
 individual content is able on us are not enabled correct as far as this require this well and
 I've heard again anecdotally that no current HD content does actually do this I'm not sure
 that's the case because I've heard also anecdotally and this is the problem it's all anecdotal
 at this point yep yep people have said oh gee you know I have a a DVI connector to my
 monitor or I have a component connector and it won't play at all right so it is possible
 that some discs are doing this or maybe the hardware is doing it on its own recognizance
 without requests from the disc I don't know well well Leo many people who have DVI I'm
 completely DVI based and not a single one of my computer monitors which is DVI has HDCP
 right because they were never intended to be you know secure content delivery screens
 so there are computers DVDs on those screens no and but that's so you're saying that even
 though the disc doesn't require it the hardware is correct so there you go I mean that's the
 problem is it's such an interlocking mess that there's all sorts of reasons why it might
 not work all related to this content protection right and and the other scary thing is that
 again what we what what's happened is all aspects of this content delivery chain are
 now locked in licenses and and proprietary intellectual property and a revocable certificates so
 I mean it is a new day yeah it is a truly a big change but but but again I I do wish that
 all VISTAs were not laden with this technology because it does seem like it's going to make
 it twitchy we really won't know for a while but I but I again I'm I'm sorry that there's
 been the the scramble and the concern and the the amount of FUD essentially that that has
 come up because Vista does so many good thing security wise right I you know I would not
 like to see people avoiding and you could argue though that the people who want the freedom
 of doing with their content what they will are probably the people who will stay on XP for
 the freedom and are less in need of the security things that you know random consumers who just
 aren't in the computers and are not listening to this podcast are going to get and so you
 know VISTAs things help those people more right that's a good point to that's right and those
 those people probably are not going to stay away because in most cases they'll just be
 buying a new computer with Vista right all right before we wrap up do you want to make
 an announcement well I do want to announce that the first freeware yeah first GRC freeware
 to to result from the security now podcast I mean this is a direct outgrowth of our work
 here is available for download it's called secureable SECUR ABLE so it's secure able
 with no he then in the middle SECUR ABLE you can find a link on the home page or it's just
 GRC dot com slash secureable I like will will tell I knew you would be I did that I did that URL for you man it
 is a very cool app it is it is it has been an eye opener for many of the people over in
 our news group who have been pounding on it and beta testing it for me and nailing out all my
 little typos in in the text the thing that is so cool about it is it will show people the
 security ability of their system many people it turns out have for example hardware depth
 capable systems certainly any who have purchased machines in the last couple years but they
 probably don't know it the so they'll get it you'll get an output that says you could
 turn on depth if you wanted well yes and in fact what's happened is we've learned so
 much already about depth I am extremely excited about it my next piece of freeware is going
 to be called deputy we already had we already had an outgrowth from this one because it is
 really the case that I mean I can't strike I can't stress this enough that that hardware
 depth when enabled properly which it is which is never the case by default because it does
 create problems for people hardware depth when enabled properly is the single greatest
 solution for all forms of buffer overrun attacks that has ever been seen I mean most
 things that have happened in the last few years would have been stopped cold if hardware
 depth had been enabled I mean it is a massively good thing for for personal security and the
 good news is it's in XP after service pack to so we this is one thing I think it's the
 single most important security measure that can be taken and sort of so certainly in the
 future we'll be spending some more time talking about what hardware depth is and it's very
 important to recognize also that software depth isn't depth at all it's just virtually
 useless turn on and use secureable to find out what else what I'm terrible tell you it
 tells you whether your chip has 64 bit capability and also whether it's got the virtual machine
 extensions either from Intel or AMD which allow you to run much faster virtual machines
 that is it the virtual machine extensions essentially make running VMs more practical
 because they are they are able to run literally at full speed by taking a whole by by essentially
 offloading a lot of the work that software was normally doing on to this the these virtual
 machine hardware technology so it's a it's a very cool thing to and of course virtual machines
 are good for security so so thus that connections speaking of virtual machines I just wanted
 to mention I met with VM where Mac world Expo last weekend their beta for Mac is out and
 it's impressive as heck and I said well how are you going to beat parallels there a third
 the cost they said wait and see the beta is free right now there'll be another beta in
 I think they said around May and then they should have it out about middle of the year
 very cool yeah we'll certainly be looking at it GRC comms slash secureable to get your copy
 of secureable S E C U R A B L E and of course GRC comms also the place to get the 16 kilobits
 versions of this show for the bandwidth impaired and Elaine's great transcriptions if you'd
 like to read along with Steve and of course let's not forget one of the reasons Steve
 can do this show and write the free software is his day job which is the great and I you
 know I'm really happy to be able to give you a plug because it's such a good program spin
 right S P I N R I T E you can go to spin right info if you want to read any testimonials you
 got any good letters these days from I have lots I do I got just a really short one that
 I really like because his subject was best program ever okay and then start six exclamation
 points and he says I would just like to thank you for saving me hours of work with your
 spin right version 6.0 program I had a HD hard disk that I could not read sectors on and
 it wouldn't even boot wow I ran I ran your program and it booted first try I was amazed
 I wanted to post this on your website for others to read but I couldn't get that news
 group program to work correctly but anyway thanks again I back this product 100% I was
 absolutely amazed how well it worked on my totally inaccessible hard drive isn't that
 nice so I do love to get those those little success stories those are terrific GRC.com
 spin right is it is really the ultimate disk maintenance and recovery tool if you have
 hard drives and nowadays we all have many hard drives so it really is worthwhile it's
 a good idea to run spin right on them how often do you recommend maybe every few months or
 yeah about every corner I would say because it actually does prevent a maintenance I have
 another letter that I will get to here in a couple of weeks where where somebody talks
 about how he purchased spin right just to support the security now podcast and all the
 work I do at GRC and he had it around when his system died and so as it happens he had
 it on a floppy well the way you run spin right is you run it in windows and it produces
 bootable media so you can either make a bootable CD or a bootable floppy if you've got a system
 that still has a floppy or even a bootable USB dongle but but the point is that if you're
 going to if you're going to do this you really do need to have spin right already running
 on you know that has already moved to a bootable media when your system dies otherwise you're
 not able to use your system in order to make the bootable media at the same time you know
 we're real good about licensing so you could certainly run on somebody else's machine or
 on a different machine of yours in order to make the bootable media but in this case the
 guy had already gone through that and had his his bootable version of spin right ready
 to go stuck it in his computer and it fixed it for excellent maybe run off and do that
 right now SPI and RITE.info and of course GRC.com Steve we'll catch you next week next week
 is a is a Q&A I was going to say are we coming up on that yeah we're on a Q&A I would imagine
 we'll have lots of questions about Vista DRM so and we will we may still talk 75 that's
 not mod 4 is it ah wait a minute no we got two weeks for that I show I show us on episode
 maybe I miscounted I thought that no you're right we're on Peter was Peter was 74 this
 is this is five I'm sorry I'm out of I'm out of sync this is you're right absolutely right
 next week is 76 so so I imagine we'll be fielding some questions from people and some experiences
 and have another really great episode somebody asked me how do you get your questions submitted
 to Steve they've been sent to me there must be a better way oh absolutely the way everyone
 does is they go to to to the security now page is GRC.com slash security now and then
 just after the page loads hit end or just scroll all the way down to the bottom and there's
 a form that you can easily fill in to submit your questions and they come right to me well
 that's easy alright hey thanks Steve Gibson once again another great show and really food
 for thought for anybody who's moving to Vista but the bottom line is it the security benefits
 of Vista outweigh these other concerns however it might be prudent to wait a little bit I
 mean it comes out January 29th if you're buying a new machine it'll probably come with Vista
 but I'm a you know I've already upgraded to Vista and I don't know some issues yet but
 I think if you if you were on the fence at all hey wait a few weeks it's not going to
 kill you to wait a month well and if you were thinking maybe of making Vista the heart of
 a next generation home theater system I would make sure that you're going to be able to
 make Vista happy make sure that your projector has a digital connection not an analog one
 because that is subject to being shut down or fuzzified so you know consider that I know
 that for example Mark Thompson loves loves Sage TV as as his you know like TV over content
 on that well exactly so I mean although he does use it you would never be able to use
 protected content unless all of your video pathway was digital and supported secure encryption
 with certificates and so forth or you download everything for BitTorrent there you go take
 that Hollywood I wonder how Elaine's going to transcribe the various grunts groans and
 moans that we've done in this show I can't wait how do you don't how do you spell I'm
 sure she'll mad at you like as Steve Gibson we'll see you next time security now
