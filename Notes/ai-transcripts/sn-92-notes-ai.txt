 Time for security now everybody's favorite weekly look at the world of security not just Windows security but all kinds of security for technology for computers and the internet
 Steve Gibson is our genial host the security expert at grc.com the creator of shields up and so many great free security utilities and of course the great
 Spinrite hard drive maintenance and recovery utility hello Steve hey Leo great to be back with you again for boy we're approaching 100 here we got to do something for the hundredth
 yeah well actually I do have a surprise oh good that'll be fun well that's not so far off but meanwhile as every fourth episode every mod for episode we do our listener questions and answers we've got quite a few
 brilliant inspired questions actually I think this is going to be a really good collection of questions I assembled them and and we ought to mention that I had said last week that we're going to begin doing sort of a mailbag and errata section at the beginning
 because I'm getting so many just nice you know that they're they're not questions for the Q&A but they're just informed comments and opinions and things yeah yeah I don't have anything other than a fun little Spinrite anecdote to share this week but in future
 weeks I'm going to take the time to read more of my mail and always a couple fun things to share at the beginning good I look forward to that that's this someone named David Ward who I actually is with a computer company well max computer he said I had a friend bring a laptop to me and tell me that the fan was failing the machine would freeze after about five minutes into the Windows XP boot process and my first thought was okay well if Windows is taking five minutes to
 boot the fan may not be your only problem but you know it does seem like this five minutes into the boot process like it's the laboring yeah exactly so he said he had taken it to three other texts who all said the same thing that the fan was failing I experienced the same problem however after booting into safe mode and having the machine stay on for an hour I knew it was not a fan issue but a hard drive issue so apparently he was able to boot into safe mode and
 not encounter whatever you know driver was being loaded that was having a problem with the hard drive and causing the this trouble so he says sure enough after running Spinrite get this for over one hundred and eighty hours that's dedication it slows down when there are disc defects right I mean it has to work harder yes it doesn't normally take that I want to emphasize this it doesn't normally take that long it's often a few hours you know maybe seven or eight but
 it is an absolutely a function of the condition of the drive the what's going on is that while we're doing data recovery I suppressed the drives normal intention to relocate the damage sector somewhere else because once it does that that sector is then unavailable you can't ever get the data back it's gone so I do a bunch of of low level commands to say to the drive okay shut down relocation don't
 move this away till I'm through with it and the point is I'm never going to have another chance to get the data back because ultimately I want to recover everything possible and then let the drive remove this damage sector from use so that the data that I put back is being put back on to a swapped in spare sector so there's much more going on under the hood than is apparent from the fact it's been right just sort of scans over the drive but it will sometimes stop and just crank
 on a single sector for quite a while and then pick up speed again and typically finished much more quickly anyway of course the story has a happy ending he says it finally finished and found many bad sectors which is the point yeah it's been right was you know working hard he says however it booted successfully then and ran very well all the customer could do was shake his head and utter the phrase amazing several times yeah of course I guess the customer had to come back a few
 days later but at least he was 180 hours later it's like a week later I just I love the stories so so keep them coming hey before we get too far
 into the show I just want to remind folks about a star oh our longtime sponsor on security now AST ARO they offer a security appliance for home and business that is just the best open source top of the line you know best in
 class programs to do every kind of security including in the new version 7 transparent email encryption and decryption that happens at the gateway
 encryption decryption digital signature all based on S minor open PGP standards it and it's it's so great because your users don't even see it also of course there's virus and content scanning on the email so you don't know fishing no spam
 you've got transparent encryption web filtering including content filtering and anti virus for the web anti spyware instant message peer to peer control as well
 you get full network protection you know intrusion detection firewall remote access and VPN by the way that new SSL VPN is so cool just goes right through the router just like that no problem
 very easy that's that's the sound of the packet grease yeah packet grease you know we're actually I mean it's this thing does everything including scaling up to 10 together you can daisy chain to give you really a great opportunity to grow with your business
 and home user licenses now or even they've included a free license for all the antivirus and any spam features it's open source it's available at AST ARO.com free to home users if you're a business call 877 the number four a star or you could schedule a free trial in your office I use
 a star security gateway in my office and it just gives you a great peace of mind protects all my systems transparently fluidly and very very efficiently AST ARO.com call 877 the number four AST ARO for a free trial in your business
 and we thank AST ARO for supporting security now we're so darn long good Pia I think it was episode 30 something that they began and more than a year now more than a year yeah we're at 92 so yeah yeah they've been really great they keep the show alive
 yeah I'm really glad that you know that we're being good for them too yes obviously they're happy and and that makes me happy
 shall we start with the Quetz Jones sir you bet you starting with John Jones from Wellington Connecticut he's wondering about the future of IP internet protocol he writes now that we all know about IP addresses and networking could you tell us about IP version six what it means the little guy do we have to go out and buy new routers
 what is it how's it going to affect us was a great question the good news is I can't imagine anything that will be more transparent essentially IP V6 does a number of things it first of all it dramatically expands
 the so called IP space that is that the number of bits in an IP address it takes it from 32 to 128 so now because that those every bit you add doubles the number of total combinations because you have all the combinations you have with the bit off
 and now all those combinations again with the bit on so each binary bit you add doubles so 32 compared to 128 I mean even though it's for only quote only four times longer it's I mean it is I don't even have the number on hand
 how many IP addresses that is it's just a you know a lot gazillion gazillion so whereas 32 bits of course gives us 4 billion 4 gig IP addresses and that's kind of a familiar number that's for example the most RAM you can put in a lot of systems is 4 gig so forth because they're 32 bit addressing
 so first of all it solves the concern that many people had a decade ago that the world was going to run out of IP I remember talking to Vince surf the father of the Internet and that's exactly what he said he said we have to go to IP V6 this is probably about almost 10 years ago
 because we're running out well turned out not didn't it yes yes what happened was not network address translation that we've talked about so often completely changed that landscape I've got I don't know 13 computers here Leo right and they actually I have a block of IP addresses
 cuz I'm a different typical user but you use me as an example I have that a star security gateway and probably a dozen computers coming off with one IP address yes and so so the idea that you could use port mapping in order to disambiguate
 data crossing a net router that really dramatically reduced the pressure from you know on the IP space but again we really looks like the Internet is here to stay it's not a passing fad
 and so everyone figured hey you know what let's just solve this problem and they they solved it by like making the addressing space so big that they never know one ever needs to worry about it running out I think Vince said that every molecule in the universe or no the galaxy could have its own IP address so it's on that large number
 yeah so people have no problem with IP enabled refrigerators and washing machines and toothbrushes here which you know you Bluetooth stuff I imagine that'll happen so it's you know it's good so so the first thing it does the the first thing IP V6 does I don't know what happened to five five just never happened because we were on IP V4 now and also one two and three sort of happened without anyone knowing the you know before the Internet all actually happened it's with 802.11c getting drunk somewhere
 okay good I believe that winning every year was done so so in addition to a much huger addressing space the only other real changes are that a number of things which were add on sort of after the fact things like IP sex security which we've talked about extensively which are not part of the IP spec
 they they were you know grafted on protocol layers that would run on top of IP that technology and additional authentication technology has been sort of subsumed by the the formal spec so so good useful things
 that you know no one back at the IP for era could have anticipated with IP V6 they're brought into and made standard in a robust fashion so that's really good now the reason I don't think this will be this will ever be anything
 other than transparent is that we still got a long way to go before IP V6 is what actually runs everything and it can be transparent because the existing IP V4 addressing space just tucks
 into one little itty bitty corner of IP V6 which is to say that IP V6 was designed as an upward compatible extension on IP V4 so that even if you had an IP V6 so-called backbone
 for example running across the country that IP V6 backbone can carry IP V4 packets with no trouble at all basically you just put a whole bunch of zeros on on on the front and IP V4 lives in a little corner of IP V6
 so so packets can come in and go out of IP V6 with no trouble at all similarly when consumer routers need to be upgraded the consumer router can simply have a firmware update that does the same thing
 is it could be IP V6 aware on the inside and the outside and perform that cross version transform easily in either direction so maybe at some future point if you had an old IP V4 router and you were using some next generation ISP
 even if they needed you to be using IP V6 you could upgrade your firmware or go out spend another 40 bucks to get an inexpensive router it's not like there's anything about IP V6 that is more expensive
 and Vista already fully supports IP V6 that was an add-on in XP you could add V6 so-called stack into XP in the case of Vista it's right there built in and running all the time so if you ever plugged into if you ever plugged a Vista system into an IP V6 system
 it would just work natively IP V6 without even needing to perform the 4 to 6 and 6 to 4 translation whatever you say I agree there you go basically it will have no effect on anyone it's just going to happen and don't worry about it
 I was just looking at the last line of John's question he says what is it and how will it affect us so that's what it is and it'll have no effect no effect Rick and Atlanta says he has something to add about multi factor authentication what we talked about
 last actually two weeks ago now on the podcast listening to the multi factor authentication episode that's episode 90 I wanted to bring attention to a method that was not mentioned possibly because it may be unknown to you both
 it's the method of using IP intelligence oh boy geo location domain information velocity checks and so forth to determine a risk factor for an online transaction and it all works transparent to the user which would make Leo happy as his biggest complaint of psyche
 do you know about this IP intelligence yeah it's an interesting additional factor now of course two weeks ago we talked about multi factor authentication and in a couple weeks we're going to have an episode titled the fourth factor
 which actually is different than this one but this is an additional factor consider for example Leo that that you're using a system as you were with site key to hook on to be of a well we do know that they will prompt you if your IP address
 changes and if the flash cookie that they're using right doesn't match up yeah but consider that they saw you were connecting from China now I don't be a bad thing I don't mean to pick on China I might be going to China
 but most cases yes it's somebody else and so what this IP intelligence is is it's a really interesting service that a number of vendors are offering as sort of a third party provider where they're able to say do we believe
 this person is in Northern California no this person appears to be on some island in the South Pacific somewhere so it's like whoops wait a minute we'll provide that information to the party that's interested in doing authentication
 so they know maybe to raise another red flag so it's a very cool solution because you know we know that in general people are going to stay relatively local and so even though you don't you're not guaranteed of that you could certainly factor that information
 to your decision about whether to trust somebody connecting based on where they're located he mentions velocity checks is that mean something like how long or how many servers is going through or how long it takes the traffic to go
 you know I'm not familiar with the term I saw that too and didn't take any time to look it up so it makes sense it's something if something's out of the ordinary about this transaction put up a few extra questions and that's exactly what Bank of America does
 the point is why not take advantage of all the information you have certainly the IP of the person connecting to you that is something as we know that cannot be spoofed because you need a direct connection to your machine now you
 would be running through multiple layers of onion routing where or or any other kind of proxy server so so that's an issue although if it's a secure connection as we assume it would be an SSL connection that cannot be routed through
 so that's a non spoofable IP address why not factor the connectors IP into the whole thing thus if IP intelligence I'm a good hacker hacker in China I'm gonna be darn sure that my IP address doesn't come from China
 but that's another matter listener Ian Williamson of Ottawa Canada has an important observation for us to share with our listeners he says since making the changes to maintain Wi-Fi radio silence something
 actually term I think you coined I think that was yeah I have noticed he says that my laptop has much more difficulty connecting to and staying connected to a weak signal from an access point in other words it's wireless performance
 is poorer than the other laptops in the same situation by rechecking the box for quote connect even if this network is not broadcasting I find that the weak signal performance is better
 maybe there was some method in Microsoft's madness of not making these updates standard issue you agree? Well I don't know but I wanted to share this with all of our listeners since back I think it was episode 86 we were talking about how to get
 a laptop to be completely radio silent so that it would not be broadcasting the fact that it exists that's the checkbox you need to turn off after you've updated yourself to the very latest set of software from Microsoft there
 their Wi-Fi update which is not part of the normal Windows update process so it's by turning that off and that's that what you have to do to cook to keep your laptop from having its own beacon where it's broadcasting its identity
 now I can't state why that would have an effect on connectivity I mean you can kind of see well okay maybe the access point if you're not sending out a beacon the access point could be configured to drop you except he's saying that it's a function
 of signal strength so it sounds sort of questionable to me but if any of our if our listeners have experienced the same thing I absolutely wanted to share it so and I'll be looking for any additional feedback from people
 to see if other people can duplicate this or if there are people who are not seeing it I know from my own experience I've not noticed that kind of issue and I'm using Wi-Fi much more that I've now now that we have WPA and I'm willing to use it at all
 and it just works fine for me with all that stuff turned off anybody who does has anything to do with RF knows it's completely a black art no one understands why anything works or doesn't work
 I mean figure it out you have no wires no wires it is I mean and people RF engineers you know I've worked with them for years and radio RF engineers you know these guys you know it's they hear something new every week you know that just
 really you're hearing the station and your teeth a okay Dave McGee of Toronto and various hotels apparently around North America asks I have a question about unsecured wireless networks
 wireless networks at home I use WPA with a 63 character PS key K obviously a longtime listener the issue is I'm never home I travel for work and rely on unsecured hotel Wi-Fi for all my work and personal Internet access
 what would you recommend I do to secure myself when on these networks I'm guessing Leo could use some advice on this as well as he travels a lot
 PS spin right rocks it's safe to drive at work thank you thank you thank you all that's nice well we certainly understand his problem and we've talked about this before but I thought it was worth reiterating
 reiterating if you're on the road even if you were able to use WPA for example to connect to a hotel's wireless network you're participating in a massive network which is fundamentally
 spoofable the problem is and we talked about this as I mentioned before is ARP spoofing which allows one person in a network to potentially insert themselves as a man in the middle by sending packets to the various endpoints
 tricking their ARP tables into believing that it is the holder of the IP's coming and going so that they send all their traffic through you it is a trivial thing to do it really exists there are free tools now on the net for allowing
 people in this situation to knit themselves in so the only thing you can do is make sure that your connections themselves are secure meaning for example if you're using Google mail you want to use secure Google mail
 HTTPS colon slash last mail dot Google dot com or you want to use some sort of a VPN ultimately that's the right solution is to use one of the free or commercial third party VPN solutions where you have a VPN client running
 on your on your laptop in the hotel room it's connecting out through the hotel network to a publicly located VPN server and we've talked about hotspot VPN as one that Leo and I have both used great success in the past
 way your traffic is is going through an encrypted tunnel until it gets way out of the hotel land environment which is so vulnerable and out onto the public internet then it's decrypted and your traffic then emerges onto the internet
 well away from the hotel that's really a solution like that is the best approach and if your business traveler often you have a VPN through your business that you could use back in in back into your corporate network
 and then just surf out from the corporate network but yeah it's a little scary you know I mean the idea of using somebody's open internet access and we talked about hotels are crazy
 well and there have been security researchers who have just sniffed the traffic in their hotel room and over the course of an evening captured 180 log on names and passwords and servers from other hotel guests
 she's famous for that just for fun she does that exactly remember that yep sort of plugged in to see what was going on yeah moving on a student who loves security now in rural Alberta wonders on sequel injection exploits do scripting
 languages like say Pearl PHP or VB script have the language constructs to allow sanitization of users input yes by the way they do in many cases
 where do I find the links that you alluded to during the podcast and the dangers of cross-site scripting would you be able to rate and compare the various popular scripting languages
 with regard to the degree of their insecurity assuming it could be quantified at all this is one for Randall Schwartz who is a regular listener and a pearl guru
 well and it's a great question the only comment I guess I would have is that first of all yes as you said any language which is doing this has string operators and the ability to process
 strings and and could be used to purify the users input data which as we saw before when we were talking about sequel injection exploits that's where the problem occurs so any language can be used to do that
 you know if I had to respond to which language is better I would say well there's really no difference because every language is equally able to do this the only thing I would say is well
 it's entirely a function of the programmer the safer language might be the one that tends to have the more security aware programmers it's all about the programmer absolutely every language has the tools
 yes pearl has some great if you go to CPAN and you look at the CPAN modules there are great modules for doing this like Libweb but you know it's the programmer has to use them exactly I remember talking to the guy from woo woo
 I can't remember his name great secure another lucky EI are you sure remember where he came from whoa yeah great security company like EI and he's a young guy and he said look it's it's simple you know use instead of using stir copy use stir and copy I mean it's little things
 and Leo you know I forgot to mention is that I really have an occasion to but in reading some background that I was reading the last few weeks I ran across the formal statement that Microsoft went through and in Vista they removed every single instance of stir copy
 because that's a clearly an invitation to a buffer overflow yes the idea is for those who are not C programmers or programmers with a similar API stir copy stands for string copy where you give it a pointer to the buffer containing a string
 the pointer to a buffer of the destination for that string to be copied to and and C strings are zero terminated that is null terminated so it'll it'll so so the stir copy command will copy all the characters from the source buffer
 source buffer to the end buffer up to and including the final terminating null or or zero bite the problem is you could see if you gave it a an extra long source string and the program was expecting a shorter
 destination or only made it was expecting a shorter string so it gave it a smaller destination buffer than a source buffer you could easily well the program would just keep on copying right over the past the end of the destination buffer
 Mr. N copy has a has a third parameter you not only give it the a pointer to the source buffer and a pointer to the destination buffer but a maximum character count to copy so you give it the size of the destination buffer
 no matter what even if it hasn't yet encountered a null terminating bite in the source string it'll stop copying at the maximum character count that you give it so it's really interesting I thought I thought when I read this it's like
 a novel Microsoft I mean you I mean that much should be allowed I mean it must have been a ton of work to go back through and change at least that you can kind of do with a globally you know searching for stir copy and find a more it was Matt Conover by the way from
 told me that and by the way you use a language that is probably the most difficult to do this in assembly language because you have to do this all by hand on the other hand since I do have to do it all by hand exactly what's happening
 exactly and I'm always having to be aware of that so it's not like I'm I'm tricked into you know lulled into a false sense of security by oh well I'm not going to worry about this I mean I got to worry about everything all the time range check everything
 Matthew Dwyer listens and writes from New Zealand he's a Kiwi I've heard you guys mentioned you don't run a software firewall at all instead putting your trust behind your external router or my case my star gateway as a hardware firewall I have a properly configured external router
 I'm nervous about running without a software firewall should I really get rid of the software firewalls on my land
 and this is a question we've had before but it keeps coming up the you know like you Leo I don't run a local software firewall although frankly on the windows firewall I leave it on so that's maybe I've changed my tune but and now that it's on by default
 Vista I just leave it on no I absolutely agree with you and in XP it's on on all my laptops where I'm where I'm running XP there's no reason not to do it the problem is that something like one of the big heavy security suites is just so cumbersome
 now I mean people I really hear reports from people talking about how like they were they removed I don't mean to pick on McAfee or semantic but those are the big guys they removed them and their system it's like young again
 yeah so so I guess my problem has become like that to unfortunate unfortunately it's not something that I any longer can in good conscience recommend as I could certainly gone a long way from 2.61 which was you know the version I loved so much so so
 I say a software firewall that does outbound blocking is really I mean that's the key everybody's got incoming blocking whether from a router or from your existing XP or Vista personal firewall built into the OS the real issue is outbound protection and I there are lots of people who just
 love having it on their system they like the idea of needing to give permission to programs in order to get outbound connection to the Internet which I fully understand
 I'm I'm taking the gamble of being really careful that nothing evil gets in because my whole theory is once that happens it's over anyway I mean that's it's too late
 so so the issue is that now the one caveat is intra land protection if none of your machines had any personal firewalls running and something evil got on one of them it could much more easily spread to the other machines on your land if you had no protection
 so I would say at the very minimum use the firewall built into windows into XP or Vista and if you wanted an additional layer protection at a software firewall but I really think if you if you protect yourself
 you're you're careful about where you go on the net what you click on and what you do you know I just I've never had a problem so they're really two compelling reasons that you might want to run a software firewall one of them is kind of dubious and that is
 for outbound protection but since many malware programs now look for the firewalls and around them so forth it's a and because most people just go yes yes yes yes yes or as our guests last week said no no no no that's a dubious merit
 the one thing is that is a value and the reason I turn on the windows firewall is this intra intra land infection so if you bring an infected laptop into your office
 well it's inside the the router and so it could infect all the computers unless they have firewalls turned on exactly so that's there are there is a good reason to leave the windows firewall and I don't think outbound protection is
 any unfortunately I don't think it's particularly compelling anymore nope do sand malletich or malletich of baba I think it's malletich of Babylon New York raises a great and distressing point during your multi factor authentication discussion one comment utterly surprised me utterly
 but did I emphasize that sufficiently either he picked himself up off the floor and went over to send us this note you're willing to provide biometrics for such low priority needs is boarding the airplane
 not only does this info contain essential personal identification actually it's not for boarding the airplane I'll explain what it's for but anyway not only does this info contain essential personal identification but it will be stored at such
 low security level that it's almost certain this data will be stolen or manipulated the service for nefarious purposes a good point I won't gain say that I should mention that the and by the way it's not a retinal scan I misunderstood that
 yeah it's an iris is an iris scan retinal scan is a is much more complicated but an iris can and it isn't for boarding the airplane it's for customs it's for crossing the border although of course you're getting on and off an airplane often but but not necessarily
 the way you are leading to the ultimate identity theft how to prove you are who you are if someone alters your biometrics data that's a side in think of that yeah only the most this guy's been reading too much Philip K Dick only the most demanding security access should be associated with biometrics if any
 so I think he raises a great point that I wanted just to discuss here and that is as always there's the issue of risk versus reward there there's certainly you know you and I were talking in two weeks ago in during the multi factor authentication
 it's like yeah let's all give you know random people are iris good point so the weekend so we don't have to wait in line right and so the idea is and again I think he makes a good point consider the trade off the idea that well yes now
 which is easy to steal my passport or my iris well you'd really miss your iris I'm just saying that I think the passport is even less secure hands mine
 yeah well but remember that's physical and physical is always a different domain but electronic true but this is multi factor they want your iris and your passport so that's that's a very good point although I guess the idea being that you know somebody could
 if if you were known to have your iris print on the server and somebody wanted to keep you they can mess with me yeah to vent to Vancouver right you know they could put some dogs iris scan in there and chances are it wouldn't match I wonder nexus must have some procedure for that
 well and you know this guy talks about low security level and of course it's gonna get stolen was like okay well yes I mean certainly after listening to mark two weeks ago every time's gonna get stolen
 well and the TSA this isn't the TSA again this is Canadian government Canadian customs and US government US customs but the TSA did just a couple of weeks ago lose a hard drive with all of their employees information on it social security numbers name address
 everything so if the I mean the TSA is not so very different from what this is so yeah he makes an excellent point you know if they had to replace all those TSA employees because of their personal data being lost I would be kind of okay
 I have to go through the TSA checkpoint next week I'm not going to say a word okay cut from the recording you know I'm sure they're TSA employees who listen and we and you know for the most part they're very jolly nice people I don't blame them for this stupid laws that require me to take off my shoes
 true and you know I actually I say look there's no metal in them let me just walk through your scanner it won't even bleep at all do they let you do that yeah they do they still won't let you bring a bottle of water in the
 no and that you know that one baffles me but don't get me started TV indie of Muncie Indiana has a question about Tivo operation Steve just to change the topic just a little little light upbeat subject I'm not sure what you said about Tivo
 and episode 90 is correct is it really right to the hard drive 24 hours a day my impression is the 30 minute buffer only exists in RAM it is only when you choose to record a program in progress that the contents of the RAM are written to the hard drive unless the program is being recorded
 and stored for later viewing I doubt that anything's being stored on the hard drive my parents have a TV that's been running continuously for nearly five years and it's the original drive would it even be possible for a hard drive to survive that long if the head state
 and continuous motion for that period of time I'm absolutely positive that the Tivo is reading and writing continuously our listeners may not know but I know you know Leo that I have three heavily hacked Tivo's I've got original series
 one Tivo's with my own expanded Linux kernel that's able to go beyond the 137 gigabyte boundary I've got each of them has a single 500 gig drive and one of the hacks you can perform on the Tivo is to change that 30 minute buffer
 so that for example it's an hour or two the the special the series one Tivo has very little RAM just enough to hold the Linux kernel and an hour or two of a video at high quality is many many gigabytes of storage
 so it's absolutely the case that Tivo's are continuously writing and reading to and from this buffer on the hard drive and yeah it does create wear and tear for the for the system
 one of the things that I do because I'm sort of a fanatic about you know hard drive life is if I'm ever unplugging my Tivo I will manually reset it and then pull the plug
 because I want to shut down the fact that it's continually writing otherwise you risk damaging the hard drive if it's writing while you pull the power so I manually restart the Tivo then pull the plug just because you know why not
 it's really it is amazing that's probably one of the hardest environments and not only is it writing all the time but it's hot in there they get very warm those drives as they do that and there's a little fan but it's a little fan and
 well all of mine have big copper heat sinks with a secondary fan he heatsink on the back of the drive itself in order to pull the heat out of the drive so that the little case circulation air has a chance to keep things cool
 so that's a third party add-on you did it's a me party yeah he's the third part would you cut up a car radiator what you did no I actually took P4 heat sinks it's all it's all jury rigged but it works great
 yeah I'd love to see your Tivo just there must be stuff sticking out all over Ted Hosman of Monterey California brought up a fantastic point I just listened to your multi-factor authentication episode loved it the process of swiping a badge and using hand
 recognition to enter a building is the same process we use at my job I work in a building that embosses over 2 million credit cards each month whoa whoa and we have about 15 million blank credit cards on hand
 oh boy where's this variance to the secure entry that we use is when we swipe our card it opens one side of a tube that we have to stand inside in order to have our hand scan once we pass the hand scan the tube has another set of doors that open into the building
 oh that way you can't have somebody a follow on that's exactly it and he's about to explain that one thing that most employees don't realize is once they step into the tube there's a weight sensor in the floor to determine if you're letting someone tailgate into the building on your
 hand scan wow it would be extremely difficult to explain to the security people why I weighed 350 pounds one day and 200 every day before and after that
 wow interesting and it brings up a point that I had not mentioned but when I was setting up my account and our server facility at level three coming up on two years ago it was two years ago after Memorial Day they specifically said
 you want to keep this place as secure as we do because your crown jewels are inside here too so you know even if somebody's getting out of the car and walking over with you at the same time do not let them tailgate
 you know you do your car do your hand scan then you know turn to them and say I hope you understand you're gonna have to do this yourself walk through the net then unlocked door and close it firmly and lock it behind you it's hard to do
 force them to off again it is but Leo it's happened a couple times and they understand they appreciate that I'm keeping them safe and their equipment safe just as I hope they will do the same for anybody else
 yeah Ryan Sullivan in New York is worried about and apparently having some trouble with Wi-Fi security he writes I listen to your show regularly and when you started talking about wireless security and how unsafe web really is I frantically tried to change my wireless security
 to PSK EIS encryption that you were talking about that's a form of WPA but I have one big problem nothing to connect my to my router when it's encrypted in AES my devices can detect the network and then allow me to type in the new password which I got from your passwords page
 but then after that they won't connect to the net the main device is annoying the main device that is annoying since I use it most often is my Nintendo we owe well the Wii is notorious for not supporting WPA
 I always use it to watch things like YouTube videos on my nice big TV I'm paranoid about security and would hate to revert back to web now that I realize how unsafe it really is I have no idea what to do
 any help if it can be spared would be greatly appreciated I'll just add that that that is a problem with some hardware including the Wii
 yes now one of the things he said though which is the reason I wanted to put this in here is that there are two versions or essentially flavors of of WPA security
 the Wii does do WPA I was thinking of the Nintendo DS ok exactly and but there are still two flavors I don't know if the Wii does both because the original the original move from WEP to WPA the people who architected this were very conscious of the fact that they wanted to fix WEP in the worst way because WEP is you know the worst Wi-Fi security
 but they were conscious of the fact that that low end Wi-Fi cards or hardware might not be able to support AES encryption just due to the the substantial processing burden that AES imposes it is it is a lot more math to be doing compared to the relatively
 an extremely lightweight RC4 encryption now we've we've talked about RC4 encryption how to pseudo random sequence generator which has is part of the reason WEP is so badly broken this episode that he was talking about was was you know how WEP is even more badly broken
 than we knew and it's now possible to did basically don't even worry about the WEP key just crack it in 60 seconds and you're on on the network so that the point is that the original the original WPA spec had something called TKIP
 temporal key integrity protocol which fixes the problem with WEP while still using the lightweight RC4 pseudo random number generator to generate random bit streams for exoring into the the user data
 which means that if it's very possible that lightweight older hardware and things that this guy may not be able to get to work with the stronger version of WPA sometimes called WPA to it would probably still work with TKIP
 so what he'll probably find if he's got a device is that he may have a choice but and certainly his router will his wireless router between TKIP encryption and AES
 does AES WPA to and TKIP okay so one thing I would recommend then is okay so so first so first of all just to finish that thought they the wireless router will have TKIP and AES there is absolutely nothing wrong with using TKIP
 go ahead use it okay yes it too was designed by the geniuses the security guys who finally came along and said okay we really need to stop using WEP let's fix WEP completely
 and they did this in WPA even in that first version that did not support the arguably stronger AES again TKIP is all you need it's all I use
 and we know how frantic I am about you know the whole issue of Wi-Fi security so the other thing I would tell Ryan is try using a simpler key first that is I love it that he's grabbed one of those humongo jumbo 33 character
 monsters from my passwords page but it could be that some of his devices are not properly hashing that into the WPA key which is actually used
 so I mean try using your dog's name for 10 minutes it won't hurt you to just try it for 10 minutes no one's going to do a brute force attack on you in that length of time or just make up seven or eight random characters that's even better
 you know the your initials your your three best friends initials or something because that's certainly going to be plenty safe try setting things up with a simple key just to get everything working then experiment with strengthening the keys
 you're making them longer making them contain more complex characters until you discover what's making one of those devices break and then back off to the best key you can use for that device and you're still going to be safe enough
 so the most important takeaway here though is it's perfectly fine to use TKIP yes the key is WPA there is there is no known weakness in TKIP people like AES because it's a new it's fancy but it's like okay RC4 actually if you want you allow it to get going and it spits out 256 random bytes
 and then on it takes something like 2 billion bytes of analysis of of what RC4 is generating even to know it's not truly absolutely random even to be able to detect that it's a pseudo random sequence generator I mean it's really good
 it needs to be used right and these problems were solved in WPA even with TKIP Russell Gad in the UK right Steve you said you carry around your WPA Wi-Fi password in a little file on a USB dongle which you then cut and paste into windows or your Wi-Fi router when it asks for your password
 as you are exposing this file to your system for a while and also passing the password through the clipboard is in there a risk of it being cached somewhere on the system which could later be found by an attacker
 this just as risky as storing your passwords on a plain text file on your PC I ask you Mr Gibson maybe you regard this as no real risk was someone getting into the files in your PC has already compromised your security
 to me it just feels a little less secure to open the file with some text processor and do this cut and paste rather than remembering some difficult to get guess password and typing it in directly
 what do you say to that Mr. Jim Gibson well security expert I mean he's got a point that I am using the clipboard now as it happens
 I always overwrite the clipboard after I've done a cut and paste that's just sort of something you learn from I picked this up I think actually it was true crypt that first alerted me to the notion because those guys really thought of everything
 and they deliberately cleared the clipboard as one of the things that they're taking care of so yes I am using the clipboard rather unavoidably in order to cut and paste my 63 character WPA password into whatever OS or router
 I'm configuring there just isn't a way around that if I want to use a really hairy password like that and you could argue that even if you type something in I mean we were hoping that the other software does the right thing with the password you give it
 sadly there are it turns out there are many instances of of security software storing on the hard disk in the registry or one place or another unencrypted passwords so again this process is all moot now he brings up the point
 that you know am I not worried about this because once some things inside then all bets are off anyway it's like well yes I mean the point of wireless is that you're using your wireless password to protect your wireless domain so that nobody on the outside can connect
 with your network so there is no way for anyone to get your password unless they're on the inside now backing off from that a bit as as Mark told us last week
 Mark Mayfrae of the eye he's all about all these basically internal exploits he recognizes that that's the next frontier for exploitation which really is what you know we've been talking about and I've been saying harping about you know browser scripting
 I mean it's clearly the problem now is people inviting these things into their systems unwittingly so you would like to not have software that got inside able to find your password and do something with it so all you can do is all you can do
 which is you know get a good password and and eliminate it from the clipboard because there have been exploits in fact where malware will export your clipboard see what's on your clipboard and send it out just because oftentimes there's something tasty that's been seen there for a few hours
 But I think the real point is that when we're talking about wireless encryption we're really talking about protecting the broadcast if somebody has physical access to your machine there's a whole host of other problems you've got
 and if something's already on the inside sure you'd like to keep your wireless password secret but on the other hand that becomes the least of your problems and also notice that it's not like having your Wi-Fi password lets the guy in China again I don't mean to pick on China but that seems to be where all this is happening
 So it's the fact that some Chinese guy had your Wi-Fi password probably is not a problem because he'd have to drive to Irvine to get a long way away or the UK in this case it's much it's a much bigger problem that he's he's rummaging around inside your network from your computer
 My hands the last question Joseph Melinson of Syracuse New York has a great question about what you called and another coinage another Gibson special Internet background radiation IBR IBR you've mentioned in past episodes about IBR
 Is this stuff caused slowdowns at bottlenecks this stuff caused potential damage to packets crossing the Internet even if it doesn't infect those packets I was wondering if there's a way to build some kind of system to attract this stuff
 But keep it from getting back on the net could programs be written to seek these worms and viruses out and destroy them in the wild was a great question because it is an interesting thing you know anybody who is looking at the logs from their routers if they still haven't turned them off
 We'll see just all this junk coming down onto their IP for the most part unless somebody is really targeting them directly this is just Internet background radiation it's it's some stuff somewhere emitting packets onto the net that happened to have your IP address
 And it could well be some some old blaster infected server located somewhere it could be you know some random PC that just you know an innocent homeowner has some sort of Trojan installed on and it's out there hunting for other machines
 With the same vulnerability it has that let it get into this first person's machine so the problem is while while most of the time the the source IP will not be spoofed meaning that they are actually trying to find you they need to respond back to them
 So it's not like it's a denial of service attack where just the act of sending a packet to you is the point the point is getting a response so they're probably not spoofing their IP meaning that if there were some sort of Internet background radiation cop
 You know somebody whose job it was to go track this down and if they could somehow get the legal authority to do this because that's the problem and also you need international treaties that allowed this because you'd have to go wherever this IP led you
 In theory yes you could backtrack all the way up find the machine and you know pull the plug on it and everybody else on the Internet would be a little would breathe a little happier because there'd be one less source of junk on the net
 At this point it's really not causing a problem if you look at the rate of noise coming into a random IP you know it's a few packets a minute it's not overloading routers it's not causing jams
 There are certainly heavily loaded routers that are because of their centralized location they're dealing with a lot more of this junk than not but on the other hand they're much more powerful and they have lots of bandwidth
 So it's really at this point it hasn't grown to the level where it's a huge problem and I think we've probably even reached a bit if you were to chart the amount of this gunk on the net over the last two decades
 It would be an exponentially flattening curve that is we're probably to the point now where new sources of radiation come onto the net at about about the same rate that old sources leave somebody finally updates their machine
 The machine just gives up and dies they lose their connection who knows what I mean there's certainly there's there's going to be some churn in the in the total source of this kind of radiation so I would imagine it's about as bad as it's going to get
 I don't think it's ever going to go away completely but I doubt that it's probably going to get much worse and it's not really at a level where anybody is motivated to go around and clean it all up because new sources are being created all the time
 I suppose you could have some sort of scrubber worm but that could cause other problems
 Well yes it's illegal also you know Mark was talking last week about the problem he faces or foresees in trying to perform security analysis of web hosted services on the internet where he's able to check outlook express
 for example to see what problems it has but if for example Microsoft did an outlook live version where people were actually using their web browser as their outlook client he's unable legally to go probe Microsoft's farm of servers
 because they're not going to be happy that he's out there looking I mean you can imagine Microsoft sees the work that EI does finding windows and finding and reporting windows vulnerabilities as a mixed blessing it does blemish them
 and but now they're forced to acknowledge that there's a problem and fix it in a few months and give us our patch Tuesdays the second Tuesday of every month so so the fact that Mark foresees this future where they're not going to be able to fix these things
 and there are still going to be problems that's a little bit chilling yeah yeah well we have completed our 12 questions for today's episode I want to thank you for all your emails and to thank Steve for his insight
 and also thank nerds on site because without them there would be no podcast nerds done site are of course our great sponsor I want to be a nerd dot coms the website they're growing they need more nerds to service their customers looking for nerds with all competencies
 as a skills from PC and Mac experts to a specialties like Cisco and Oracle fix it technicians website designers programmers project managers even sales even trainers and of course they're more than a few security experts listening who could definitely find a place
 on any virus gurus to they especially like those nerds who troubleshoot tear apart and rebuild their own systems in their spare time nerds are independent contractors so you're still in business for yourself but not by yourself you focus on your passion and not the burdens of running a business
 all over the world seven countries and more all the time Canada US Mexico England Australia South Africa Bolivia think a couple more nerds on site has over 250 competencies in their university of nerdology ranging from systems architecture design
 and software development on source I T departments to desktop support and so or residential I T services look if you're a nerd and you love working with people I want you to go to www dot I want to be a nerd dot com register for a nerds only meeting in your area
 day who knows who you might see at the next nerds on site meeting thanks for their support to of security now we can be very grateful to Elaine who will make a transcription of this so you can read along as you listen
 there are 16 kilobits versions along with the transcripts and notes available on SteveSightGRC.com.
 And that's also where you'll find his program SpinRight, the world's finest hard drive maintenance
 and recovery utility for the last decade or so. Do you know Leo, 20 years? 20 years. Yes.
 You have updated it. Oh, yeah. We're version 6.0. I'm just teasing you. I don't want anybody to
 think it's a 20 year old program. GRC.com. He cleans it up all the time, always working to make it
 finer. And by the way, while you're there, check out Steve's free security updates and utilities.
 There's so many good little programs there, including shields up, which will be at its 50
 millionth user in a day or so. Wow. And a secureable, a new one, and de-combobulate and shoot the
 messenger. Unplug and pray. Many, many more. GRC.com. Any other, any final thoughts, Mr. G?
 I think we're set. I'm looking forward to, as I'm sure our listeners are, a week from now,
 we'll be back again for another fun episode of Security Now. We'll see you then.
