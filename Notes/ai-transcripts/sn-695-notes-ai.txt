 cash fly calm well, Mary Christmas happy new year
 Everybody Leo Laport here Steve Gibson has the day off. He has the week off
 It's not easy to convince Steve to take the week up or hoping that if he takes some time to himself
 He could finish squirrel get back to spin right six and all the things we've been waiting for we sure
 Steve we'd sure like to see those under the tree this year and maybe
 2019 anyway, it was an amazing year for security now
 The I remember when Steve and I first started talking about doing this show 15 years ago
 Hard to believe Steve was concerned. There wouldn't be enough security news every week to fill a half hour
 Well, the show's grown to two hours every week and there's still not enough time
 Man, we had a lot to talk about one of the number one stories of the year
 story that continues even to this day the problems Intel's having with speculative execution watch
 All right, Steve you have a picture our picture of the week. Yes
 Is more it's more what I was expecting when I said last week
 That the the consequence of being forced to flush the
 Page look up tables to me was mind-boggling, you know
 I'm old-school and I don't really believe any of this works. I've I mean just it's like no that can't get off the ground
 So, you know, the idea is as I was explaining last week
 the virtual memory mapper in Intel architectures is this three-level lookup table where the the
 The address that you're
 Fetching isn't the actual physical address at all. It's an index into a table
 Which is in index into a table which is an index into a table and and you need all of those in
 Order to figure out what the value is and you do cache the result and those tables are cached and that's what's called the TLB the
 Translation look aside buffer because the there's this notion in in general in computing that
 Something you've done recently you are more likely to do again than not and the classic example is looping if you are looping
 Over some code that means you go back to the top and you do it again with different values or for, you know
 Different inputs or something but but so that says that oh look I'm rerunning
 Instructions that I recently ran so this is why the whole concept of caching makes sense
 we have we have dynamic memory the main motherboard, you know the whatever it is four eight sixteen gigabytes of
 main ram
 because due to the
 Technology it has
 It fell behind a long time ago in keeping up with our processors
 They just no one has been able to make main memory
 Go fast now, we've talked about little interesting ideas
 There's some cross wire technology that HP is kind of trying to get off the ground Intel has it to
 Across point so maybe we'll see something dramatic happen
 But so far main memory isn't is compared to the way our processors have just leaped ahead in speed
 It's the laggart so
 so it's necessary to
 To use this notion of
 Reusing something or hoping that you're going to be able to reuse something you recently
 Slowly fetched from main memory
 Again, so all of these modern chips have on chip caches and you mentioned L2 L1 L2 L3
 They're in they're in a hierarchy
 the the ones closest to the chip are the fastest and the smallest and
 There's a next level further back and then a third level and they each get larger and
 Sometimes slower but out but also it's more of a function of access patterns when you've got multiple cores now
 You've got different processor cores all competing with each other for sharing this common pool of cash
 All which is trying to provide just arrange to feed these hungry chips
 Data as quickly as they need it so so also shared are these
 virtual memory lookup tables and so what I was saying last week was you know the idea that
 Crossing from the user land user code to the kernel
 Would require the flushing of that?
 incredibly
 Valuable because it's so slow to get it to load it the idea that it would force the flushing of that cash
 Was just like I know as I said, I don't really believe any of this works to start with
 I've sort of reluctantly agreed that okay Wi-Fi seems to be working but somehow at
 Ridiculous speeds, you know and when modem started going to 56k it's like what no modems go at 300 bod or maybe 12
 But you know not 56k, but yeah, they somehow did
 so
 Okay, so this picture
 Demonstrates what what happened on one of three of epic games servers?
 When they installed the meltdown
 Mitigation and this is much more in keeping with with what with what I expected
 So you can't see it, but there are three chart lines
 There's green orange and blue as there's a little index down in the lower left a little key showing them
 and so and what what you see is this sine wave which anyone who's run a big server is familiar with that's the
 diurnal cycle of
 Of CPU being busy you notice it it hits a nader
 It they're all kind of lowest around 4 a.m. And I'm not sure if this is you know you
 UTC or or what time zone but but then it also peaks all pretty much on the opposite side of
 The day and so that's just sort of generally people are sleeping and then they're waking up and doing stuff. Well
 That sudden jump is
 One of the three processors the green trace
 where meltdown mitigation was applied and
 It's about two and a half times if we if you look at at the low point there of all the traces a little just before 4 a.m
 It you can see that crosses right around 10% and now if you look up at the green line
 It's more than 25% it's like maybe about 27% whereas the other guys are at 10
 so that's as that's I mean that's
 in for their use case the meltdown mitigation
 Jumped their processors utilization of CPU utilization
 by about 2.7
 which
 I believe based on the severity of the need to discard this slow to acquire
 Cash data every time you switch between the kernel and and the user so
 Anyway, this is the kind of picture that I that is what I was expecting
 Rather than this, you know, we've heard all 1% or point something or maybe five or I was like, okay
 You know again if you it is completely a function of what you're doing
 We would talk about kernel mode access you need compared to how much user mode
 Well, actually it's how much crossing it's the boundary crossing
 Right, so if you go into the kernel and you read read read read read and then you exit the kernel
 Right, then there's that one swap then
 But if you go back and forth, that's when you get the biggest hit right where because you don't want user mode
 To have access to kernel mode information. So you flush the cache
 You go into user mode and then you go back to kernel mode. Do they flush it twice?
 They flush it when you go back in the kernel mode. No, you wouldn't need to then
 Correct. You don't you don't need to well, you don't need to flush it when you go from the kernel
 I mean what when you go from the user to the kernel because we trust the kernel, right? There's no malware there
 It's user code
 Looking at the residual
 From being in the kernel and so it's when when you switch to the user that the kernel needs to remove it's
 What I described last week as footprints, you know because essentially
 And this comes back to that statement I made in any setting where and caching is a perfect example
 It's not speculation. We'll we'll talk about that in a second
 But in any setting where short-term performance optimizations have global effect a sufficiently clever task
 Can infer the recent history of other tasks by observing its own performance in other words
 So caching is a short-term performance optimization
 And if the cache is global that is every it's if everybody gets the benefit of it
 then
 clever tasks
 Can figure out what's in the cache and what isn't by making a fetch
 And observing how long it takes observing its own performance
 and so so the the 20,000 view the 20,000 foot view here is
 is that
 What we the way we've been cruising for the last several decades is
 We've been creating faster
 performance
 by
 creating
 Processors that are increasingly clever about
 optimizing
 What they expect to have happen next
 but that expectation whether it's cache or whether it's
 specular
 Architecture that we'll be talking about speculation
 That that inherently
 inherently
 Allows these kinds of problems
 And so that's why this is as I said before this is
 Industry shaking. I mean this again. This has always been sitting there
 Nobody really worried about it until now everybody's worrying about it. So
 And we don't know who knew about it and when I mean we learned it now, but who knows
 Although it feels like this is and and this is the other thing i've been speculating on
 And I can't remember if it was Bruce schnire or brine curbs talked about the synchronicity
 The fact that two different teams simultaneously discovered this
 I would guess security researchers
 Kind of run down similar avenues 14 actually four teams
 Well, if you broaden the window a little bit within a couple months and that that was Bruce talking about this through so and there is
 You know, there is a security community. There's conferences
 There's papers being published everybody's reading everything
 And so it's not like there's been no cross-pollination at all
 So it may have been for example that last summer somebody did something or you know
 Like cash timing is that that's now a thing and rome hammer maybe something exactly so there's sort of there
 You know, there is something kind of in the air
 Where individual researchers will you know, kind of think huh? I'm going to spend some time thinking about this
 You know and and and because they're often researching in a silo
 Within their own group or their own team or their own university or their own corporation
 You know, they're and they're wanting to produce results that are you know proprietary until they're not until they're publicly disclosed
 Especially if it's something like this where they have to you know whisper what they found to
 The parties who are affected there. There's not they're not going to be talking about it
 So it's it's it is interesting but not surprising that that suddenly this just kind of all happened
 It was probably set up by you know, again
 Just sort of what was in the air in the last few years and eventually bound to happen
 Intel has just reversed its so-called advice
 To all of its OEMs saying stop stop stop stop
 Patching anybody's firmware
 We made a mistake in in last week's firmware and I don't remember if we touched on it last week, but there were
 it was it it's hard to
 Nail them down they're saying something as fuzzy as may
 Cause reboot issues or may make your system reboot more often
 It's like wait a minute more often than never often
 More often than what you know, you know in other words this causes a catastrophic crash
 Of your system, but they don't want to use those words. Yeah, so
 Yesterday the newsroom of intel sent out
 Quote as we start the week
 I wrote writes in first person this newsroom
 Mr. Sona. Yeah, uh, yeah, I
 Want to provide an update on the reboot issues. We reported
 January 11th
 Okay, so that was 12 days ago
 But 11 days ago yesterday
 We have now identified the root cause
 for broadwell and haswell platforms
 And made good progress
 There leo they're making good progress. Wow. Well, uh in developing a solution to address it
 Over the weekend and walwork. I'm you can just imagine there's like a lot of late nights over there at intel
 Over the weekend. We began rolling out an early version of the updated solution
 to industry partners for testing. Oh, so everybody was awake and
 We will make a final release
 Available
 Once that testing has been completed
 Okay, but not now not yet
 Based on this we are updating our guidance
 For customers and partners
 We recommend that oem's cloud service providers system manufacturers software vendors and end users
 Stop deployment. Oh my god
 current versions
 And those of you have already installed it. Oh gee, we're sorry
 Oh, and actually that's happening del has announced in following the guidance that they will be offering previous
 versions of the firmware immediately
 Because like to just because now intel is scared everybody that reboots might happen any minute
 So this is though, but it's haswell and broadwell system. It's not coffee lake kb lake. It's not the more modern systems
 It's oh, no, it's no. No, it is they haven't they haven't gotten to those. Oh, great. Oh, yeah, it's everything
 so it's okay, so
 They're saying stop deployment of current versions as they may introduce
 Get this again higher than expected
 reboots
 What? Well, okay, like i'm not expecting any so
 I guess a reboot which is unexpected
 Well, which you didn't you know control alt delete, you know to make happen or pull a plug out or something
 Anyway, may reboot and they say other
 unpredictable
 System behavior now by its very nature
 Unpredictability is something you are working to avoid in your processors
 so
 Yeah
 Then they say for the full list of platforms see the intel.com
 security center site
 which is very busy lately
 some researchers
 at a
 Security firm in Tel Aviv named check marks
 took a look at tinders ios and android mobile apps
 And we're surprised to find that it lacked
 HTTPS encryption if you can believe it or not
 anyone sharing
 the same Wi-Fi
 as a tinder
 an ios or android mobile tinder device or tinder app user
 Can see your tinder photos?
 Add their own into the photo stream and track what you do on tinder
 um
 They're not using encryption to keep the photos safe from
 Anybody who wants to eavesdrop and although apparently they are using encryption for
 encrypting the actions of a tinder user
 the
 encryption is spotty
 and it turns out that
 that
 Even looking at the encrypted stream it is possible to ascertain what the user is doing
 so uh check check marks produced a proof of concept app called tinder drift
 which is demoed on youtube which reconstructs
 any tinder users online session of what they see and the way they respond to what they see
 essentially unmasking
 any person's behavior who is using tinder on shared you know on a shared
 uh ethernet medium like Wi-Fi so although again the swipes and matches
 are encrypted check marks explained and proved um hackers sharing the same
 uh
 Wi-Fi are able essentially to completely unmask
 everything that is being done uh
 The it turns out that the specific patterns of bytes that represent a left swipe a right swipe
 a super like whatever that is and a match are all
 clear
 But even though technically they're encrypted nobody at tinder really gave the security of their application
 much thought apparently or any real concern concern over protecting the privacy of their users
 um the verge in their coverage asked tinder to respond to this
 and so tinder did respond saying that the unencrypted photos are profile pictures
 and tinder is a free global platform so the pictures are quote available to anyone
 swiping on the app anyway of course what isn't free and global are are the individual tinder
 users choices and reactions to those unencrypted unprotected photos which this research demonstrates
 was poorly concealed so i'm glad again this is i mean we just keep seeing example after example
 maybe we just talked about it with it with tavis and blizzard and here now check marks
 in Tel Aviv and tinder um where we we have to have oversight we have to we have to have an
 environment where it is where security firms and researchers are able to examine these things
 and and i'm thankful that they're willing to volunteer their time and do so you know they bring
 some some beneficial positive press to themselves for doing so and in the process you know it's
 benefiting the users of these applications for which it's clear not enough attention has been
 given to security hello security now listeners i want to tell you uh a true story on this holiday
 a true story of a young podcast network looking for a way to get our shows to you with minimal fuss
 minimal expense uh minimal trouble we stumbled upon i was very lucky actually
 a guy named matt levine one of the founders of cash fly approached me i think it was at a podcast
 expo said we should be we should be working together i said well tell me about it cash fly
 is a CD and a content distribution network and we've been on cash fly now ever since then
 about 10 years more than 10 years not 1 3 a.m phone call the CD ends down not one moment of
 concern about the bill logging in you know have you ever done this if you have a CD and anybody
 delivers content to customers whether it's a an app a podcast whatever you you probably know this
 feeling of gosh are we gonna go over our monthly allocation this month what are we gonna do well
 we had a really successful show lots of people downloading the app oh no and you're logging in
 your CD and how did we go over the capital good not with cash fly they work with you to tailor
 your plan to your yearly usage trends it smooths out all the peaks and on average customers who
 switch to cash fly save 20 percent by the way cash fly the nicest people in the world an expert
 team of smart easy to talk to agile techs they can answer all your questions of first time you
 will not be put inside a corporate phone tree no they care about you they care about their customers
 and they guarantee get ready for this 100 percent availability with their bulletproof 100 percent
 SLA i will vouch for that not what we haven't we literally pump petabytes worth of data through
 cash fly every single month every show when you download the show audio or video you get it from
 cash fly through our cash fly CDN that means the server is close to you it's fast and we haven't
 lost a single bit 10 years a decade not one bit lost i love you cash fly you will love cash fly
 too cash fly has been building trusted CDN relationships since 2002 since before podcast listen to if
 you don't believe me listen to ours technica ours technica's director of technology quote
 sometimes we have spike events sound familiar spikes in traffic generating 15 to 16 million page
 views whoa with cash fly you don't see an issue the CDN just absorbs it our customers
 commend us on that and i commend cash fly on that same experience a decade without a bit lost
 you're gonna love cash fly so here's my invitation to you let cash fly give you some sanity back
 their special offer has been extended just for twit listeners you go to security now.cash fly.com
 okay that's a special URL they know then you heard it on security now so it helps Steve helps me
 security now.cash fly.com it will help you too because you will get up to five thousand dollars
 in service credits but you have to sign up by the end of the year by December 31st and you have to
 migrate sometime in 2019 sign up by the end of the year migrate by 2019 and up to five thousand
 dollars in service credits and of course they'll go through your bill and they can explain to you
 why cash fly is better it's better that's why security now that cash fly.com we thank cash fly
 as always for their support you've heard it at the beginning every every podcast for 10 years
 bandwidth for security now is provided by cash fly at cac h-e f-l-y dot com security now
 cash fly.com thank you cash fly. oh back to the show. The Wyoming and New York's governors had both
 signed some executive orders and just as we were starting the podcast news came that the California
 Senate had passed I think it was 21 to 12 a similar some similar legislation the idea being that
 that states have a lot of power over you know what happens within their borders and while
 even though the major ISPs were lobbying hard to prevent states from going their own way
 relative to net neutrality it turns out there's there are strict limits over what the federal
 government can do because for example states have control over their purse and they can decide
 how they want to spend their money so what happened was that we had a a bill that that passed through
 California's Senate that is now moving on to the assembly and and I just checked my notes it did
 pass 21 to 12 however this is this looks like it's just the beginning there are also a group of
 22 state attorneys general that have have gathered together and filed a suit against the FCC it
 turns out that it it turns out it's not possible much as the FCC would like to simply change their
 own rules there are there's laws that govern what the FCC is able to do and it's necessary for
 the FCC to demonstrate that conditions have changed sufficiently since an original law was put in
 place for them to use that to justify subsequent change and that hasn't happened since the net
 neutrality law was was brought up the they've called the open internet order in 2015 so it turns
 out that that 22 states have joined together in a an action against the FCC to challenge the you
 know adjectives much noticed decision just to toss that 2015 decision out but more importantly the
 EFF of course our friends at the electronic frontier foundation are very much involved in this
 they posted a sort of a response to California's action sounding a little annoyed apparently they
 were involved in the in the lawmaking and for whatever reason I don't know anything about what's
 going on behind the scenes politically but the legislation which California has passed so far
 they worry would not stand legal challenge Ernesto Falcon writing for the EFF said that there were
 there were much stronger things that California lawmakers could have done and he enumerated three
 which are really interesting so I wanted to share them with our listeners because this gives us a
 sense for just how much clout states actually do have over what goes on inside their borders
 first Ernesto writes that California spends hundreds of millions of dollars on ISPs including AT&T
 as part of its California broadband subsidy program he says the state could require that recipients
 of that funding provide a free and open internet to ensure that taxpayer funds are used to benefit
 California residents rather than subsidizing a discriminatory network he writes this is one of
 the strongest means the state has to promote network neutrality and it's missing from this
 legislation which just passed which was SB 460 secondly he writes California also has oversight
 and power over more than four million utility polls that ISPs benefit from accessing to deploy
 their networks in California oh it says he says in fact California is expressly empowered by federal
 law to regulate access to the polls and the state legislature can establish network neutrality
 conditions in exchange for access to the polls he says again that is not in the current bill passed
 by the senate and then third each city negotiates a franchise with a local cable company and often
 the company agrees to to a set of conditions in exchange for access to valuable taxpayer-funded
 rights of way California's legislature he says can directly empower local communities to negotiate
 with ISPs to require network neutrality in exchange for the benefit of accessing taxpayer-funded
 infrastructure he says this is also not included in the California bill so I thought you know I just
 I wanted to do some more digging into this because of course this has been a big topic of hours and
 of huge interest and the the voting public has demonstrated overwhelming support for the concept
 of net of net neutrality which for reasons of the way Washington works with power brokers and
 lobbying and money isn't what our government has been doing but it looks like at the state level
 you know there is very very strong capability of of enforcing this locally so as I noted at the top
 I think we're far from losing this as a consequence of the nature of this so-called industry of iPhone
 cracking we don't have definitive information from Celebright and and we're not going to
 but all of the evidence suggests that Celebright may now be able to unlock
 from iPhone 5 through iPhone 10 I mean inclusive all of them there was some good coverage in Forbes
 Thomas Fox Brewster writing for in his security column for Forbes he says in what appears to be
 a major breakthrough for law enforcement and and again with caveats that you know we don't know
 absolutely positively for sure but it's worth just putting it on everyone's radar and a possible
 privacy problem for Apple customers he writes a major US government contractor claims to have
 found a way to unlock pretty much every iPhone on the market Celebright the Israeli based vendor
 that's become the US government's company of choice when it comes to unlocking mobile devices
 is this month telling customers its engineers currently have the ability to get around the
 security of devices running iOS 11 that includes the iPhone 10 a model that Forbes has learned
 was successfully rated for data by the Department of Homeland Security back in November 2017 so last
 November most likely with Celebright technology he writes the Israeli firm a subsidiary of Japan's
 Sun Corporation hasn't made any major public announcement about its new iOS capabilities
 but Forbes has told was told by sources who asked to remain anonymous as they weren't
 authorized to talk on the matter that in the last few months the company has developed
 undisclosed techniques to get into iOS 11 and is advertising them to law enforcement and private
 forensics folk across the globe indeed he writes the company's literature for its quote advanced
 unlocking and extraction services offer offering now notes the company can break the security of
 quote Apple iOS devices and operating systems including iPhone iPad iPad mini iPad pro and iPod
 touch running iOS 5 to iOS 11 so then Thomas's column goes into much greater detail citing
 interesting but you know necessarily hearsay accounts of various models of iPhones being
 accessed but as always you know without absolute definitive detail but of course that's because
 Celebright protects these secrets as much from Apple as it as like from their own customers
 you know they could probably put this in some software they might be able to package it in
 something that they sell but Apple would be first in line to purchase it through through a cutout
 and figure out what Celebright is doing and assuming that they really wanted to fix the problem
 so the way this works is phones must be physically sent to Celebright for them to work their magic
 and then they either unlock and extract or provide some means subsequently for after the phone is
 returned probably for forensics reasons to allow the authority that had had that device in their
 possession to then get access to it so again this is hearsay and rumor seems to be pretty well
 sourced however so who knows you know what they're doing what what in they may have found
 but it does look like if this is to be believed there may be a way in given you know this sort of
 extreme access where you have to have you know it has to go to Israel in order to in order to be
 cracked the picture I have in the show notes is of yesterday's rerecord breaking attack showing
 basically a timeline of prior attacks one and I can't quite read it looks like maybe it's 2001
 can't see it was anyway it's 24 gig that it was like whoa 24 gig oh what um and then a few years
 later 100 gig Leo oh my god you know 100 gig and then a few years later 309 oh three times more
 more than three times more than 100 309 a few years later now we're up to about looks like about 2016
 650 gigs okay you know wow now yesterday yesterday 1.7 okay so I could say it as 1700 gigabits per
 second or 1.7 terabits per second is where we are a a internet melting DDoS attack as I mentioned at
 the top of the show this is the result of a devastating service being exposed publicly what's
 really curious is that this had been noted a couple years ago in some of the black hat Defcon
 style conferences it might have been one of the two of those someone just sort of noted in passing
 that and it may have been that no one thought anyone was crazy enough to have this publicly
 exposed but there's a service on Linux platforms called Memcache or because it's a service Memcache
 D for Damon meaning that it's running in the background it is a very simple very fast cache
 the idea being that because you might have a very complex SQL database query after performing
 a complex lengthy SQL database query you might want to do some short-term caching
 so it could be in RAM or it could be on the hard drive depending but the idea being that
 you've you've performed some extensive query you may need it again you don't want to go back and
 and reissue the query so you use this sort of this intermediate cache where you use a you use a
 key or a tag and the data so it's it's very simple you can't do any fancy queries you can just say
 here's a blob stored under this index and so this Memcache says okay and and it is accessible
 over both TCP and yes I did say both both TCP and UDP well we know what that means
 if it's publicly exposed the problem with UDP is there is no provision for verifying the source
 IP of a query as we've often discussed with TCP you need to there is it this the famous three-way
 handshake a sin for synchronized goes in one direction a sin with an ACK acknowledging the
 receipt of the sin goes in the other direction and then finally an ACK acknowledging the receipt
 of the second sin makes the third the third interchange of the three-way handshake
 the constant the an interesting side effect is that is it both endpoints have to tell the truth
 about their IP addresses in order to receive each other's acknowledgments otherwise it doesn't
 happen so TCP cannot be spoofed UDP is used for lightweight internet traffic where you simply say
 give me something like give me an IP address for DNS and DNS is UDP and DNS has been used in so
 called amplification and reflection attacks it's amplification because a tiny query can generate
 a large response so what that means is that an attacker is able to send little DNS queries to
 a DNS server which will respond with much larger replies thus amplification but because it's UDP
 nothing prevents the the instigator of the attack the person sending the UDP packet from
 lying about their IP they put the IP of the intended victim the target in the UDP packet
 so that this the DNS server that receives it believes that guy was asking for a DNS address
 and so the larger the larger response goes to the victim of the attack thus
 it is the attack is reflected off of the DNS server and amplified a reflected amplification
 attack using UDP well there's a but there have been a bunch of different types of UDP services
 exposed and used over time they all pale in comparison to this one of course 2018 I hope
 you're enjoying by the way hello this best of security now the first time Steve's ever let us
 do this holiday best of it's kind of fun to get back and think about all the security nightmares
 we've suffered through over the year 2018 it was an election year and of course everybody was very
 concerned about election security Steve had this to say for the sake of just not leaving
 something out that probably doesn't really matter um well at where I guess it matters because it
 just demonstrates sort of how nothing is happening like that should there was what made the news
 is it the US Department of Homeland Security has designated election systems as a sub-sector
 of the country the US's critical infrastructure um after the intelligence community broadly
 concluded last year that Russia had tried to interfere with the 2016 US US presidential election
 as a consequence there's it turns out there's something that I was really never very aware of
 that they're called ISACs which are abbreviated as the abbreviation for information sharing
 and analysis center which I you know is our tax dollars here in the US apparently spinning around
 in circles and getting nothing done oh man uh let's look at this website I have a link here in the
 show notes national isax.org forward slash member hyphen isax isacs um and so there's already a
 bunch of them who knew um for and I'll just give you I'll read down to the eyes in alphabetic
 order automotive aviation communications defense industrial base downstream natural gas
 as opposed to upstream natural gas I guess electricity emergency management and response
 financial services health care information technology okay and then that gives you an idea
 so who knows what this is I mean it just it's bureaucracy uh at its finest um and the problem of
 course is that so the idea is that states and localities are supposed to become members of the
 election systems isac and I don't know what happens then I mean the problem is and we've
 been discussing voting machines for years which arguably are based on last year's black hat and
 defcon horrifically insecure and I mean we've talked about unauthenticated what remote Wi-Fi
 access evil made access where there's a like an active USB port on the side and you can just kind
 of sally up next to the machine and slip your slip it a view a thumb drive and take it over
 remotely and make it reboot and dump its contents out and we were talking earlier this year about
 the problem that that the black hat and defcon conference organizers are having for this
 coming summers events because now the people who had traditionally been reselling these machines
 are being illegally threatened by though their their machines manufacturers against reselling
 with attorneys writing them fraudulent letters claiming that it's illegal to resell them
 and you know this certainly after a while we're approaching the end of year 12 now and
 it's if nothing could be more clear to us and our audience than that this whole process is
 completely bassacwards I mean completely broken what there should be is the kind of process that
 we'll be discussing that that that adopted and ratified TLS version 1.3 which is a standard
 that that industry and academia together worked on polished refined argued over fought over
 wrestled to the ground tested implemented and and just absolutely nailed and now it is being
 adopted that's that's the process that we should have for something very in many ways sort of similar
 to that has that shows many similar characteristics to voting automation it the idea that that debold
 pronouncing the name correctly this time could could offer for sale a black box that that people
 adopt and use for something as important as voting where it's all this is our proprietary
 technology and and you can't see inside but trust us no no I mean and it's just it's insane that
 this is you know that unfortunately this aspect of capitalism has been allowed to take hold and
 be employed in in the US or any you know election system it ought to be an open standard developed
 in full view and then yes I have no problem if then companies want to compete on implementing
 the standard which is created which is what we do now where we have other standards
 though the standard is open you you implement the standard you it is verified that you have done
 so correctly and then you're welcome to sell your hardware that runs the the system that has been
 universally agreed upon and pounded on you're welcome to sell that fine but you know this notion
 that oh you know we've got the greatest security experts and after all we're us who cares anyway
 so nothing is happening and I don't I don't know how like how long it's gonna take for for anything
 real to happen but as long as we allow closed architecture voting which is what this has become
 you know I mean and this is why now you know they're saying okay well let's get a paper trail
 okay well okay I guess that's better but it still seems a problem medical so you know this is a
 problem we know how to solve but unfortunately commercial interests in this country are preventing
 its proper solution so who knows when that'll change but however you know creating a new
 bureaucracy to talk about it doesn't seem to me like we're moving in the right direction day
 April 17th I guess as a consequence of the fact that April 15th fell on a Sunday that must be why
 yeah and Monday is was like Emancipation Day in Washington DC so oh okay so you know in the US
 for those who are not in the US are so-called internal revenues service the IRS this is our tax
 filing deadline date for that 2017 calendar year and and one of the the headlines I got I got a
 kick out of said that the IRS's e-filing system is wait for it overtax uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh that just
 sounds like clever headline writer because what I saw was that the IRS didn't know why it wasn't
 working they don't know so it may not be overtaxed it may be something under attack yes yeah um so
 basically our our us e-filing system which which one would expect to be heavily used is not been
 working well all day and as we know it is extremely difficult now nowadays to to keep a system online
 that you read that for which there's any reason for bad guys to want to have not be online there
 there's um so many ways now with DDoS amplification attacks and the ready availability of things that
 can attack in order to launch these attacks that I mean as we've been talking about we're a 10 year
 old and in Columbus, Ohio right yes yes it doesn't have to be in nation states mounting an attack against
 the IRS in the US and probably isn't it's just somebody who says hey you know this is the the time
 that all of that lots of people are going to be trying to be filing their taxes at the e-filing
 website so let's just take those guys offline and uh if that's the case I mean we don't know
 but uh I guess there was some IRS person was giving testimony in front of Congress and they
 know that's kind of not a big high-profile issue just some meeting somewhere and one of the one
 of the Congress uh people said so uh do you know that the e-filing system is offline right now
 and he's like oh uh well yes we're looking into that and uh we expect it to be backup later today
 which which apparently they have no idea what's wrong oh and the other it's been eight hours at
 least the last time I checked and it says that it's a planned outage no that's not true no no I
 know I saw a screenshot that seems stupid if you plan an outage on tax filing day wouldn't that be
 bad planning oh man I wouldn't put it back to them it said April 17th 2018 planned outage so
 which basically means it wasn't planned but they're there they have a but the message was planned
 to appear and declare that it was planned unbelievable so yeah the echo was a breakout product not too
 long ago it was the center of Amazon's new voice assistant market and um even at that time there
 was a worry that the devices are listening to us and now we actually know well of course they are
 yeah so um a group named checkmarks has successfully demonstrated a persistent listening skill
 for the echo as we know uh the echo is extensible they uh amazon produces and publishes an api
 which developers can use in order to create new skills which users can download and add to their
 echo in order to do things um what they did was created a proof of concept which to me seems sort
 of like wait a minute you mean it's vulnerable to that um they created a a calculator app which
 appears to be a voice driven calculator okay that's you know I guess that's a skill um but when it
 launches it spins off a secondary background non-terminating task which causes any such skill
 enhanced amazon voice assist device because there's a bunch of different ones you know different
 sizes and shapes now to indefinitely record all surrounding audio eavesdropping on users
 conversations while also streaming the audio to a third party server somewhere so I mean it's like
 everyone's worst fear about what could happen if you have an internet connected
 microphone you know in your like deliberately in your midst presumably located somewhere like
 that's not in the closet it's out where everybody where it can hear everybody because that's what
 it's supposed to be doing um they reported the issue to amazon and the company has addressed the
 problem though not very robustly in my opinion uh they're in the in the reporting of this they said
 they now regularly scan for malicious skills that quote silently prompts or listens for
 unused for unusual lengths of time then kicks them out of their official store and I don't know uh
 to me for something as important as the security this feels like an immature and not very well
 thought out API um no skills that is you know these add-ons should have any such access
 like direct access to the system's microphone um rather any skill should register its microphone
 usage and access policy whatever that is um and its needs as part of an unhackable signed
 policy packet which you know amazon approves then the developers incorporate into their skill
 and then it can't be hacked afterwards and then the device's API should grant
 the skills requests which are filtered through and enforced by the previously declared and
 approved policy I mean it's like this is how you solve that problem these are not hard things to
 do and I'm just sort of I'm surprised that in this day and age a obviously security conscious
 company could produce an API that allows a skill to establish a background task which leaves the
 microphone running and streaming data to the internet it's like how how do you do that right
 right yeah I mean my understanding was the voice activation part was tied directly to the operating
 system and it did submit information to amazon but you're right why would a skill ever need that
 because the skill is triggered by a voice prompt it's it's not as if it's running waiting for the
 voice prompt right right I just like okay let's hope they get this right um and probably I mean
 what they would have to do now would be to re-engineer the API with additional security
 maybe taking the lessons that they've learned because I'm sure they've learned some lessons
 since its release and just do it v2 API and over you know give developers some time to migrate their
 skill to the v2 um and then just shut down access to the version one API that is obviously not
 secure I mean the idea of oh uh we didn't realize that uh skills could listen persistently and stream
 audio over the internet so we're gonna periodically scan to see if that's happening what
 no we can't keep people out of your home but we'll drive by every once in a while to see the
 lights are on right see it's perfect everyone's still breathing happily my lord now I got an echo
 early on um and um I hook it up every once in a while because there are some projects that I love
 doing with the echo however one of the very first things that I did when I got one was I set up an
 AP running through a tap connected the echo to that AP and what concerned me was all the outbound
 traffic that I saw when I was not doing anything how noisy it is and that that really really concerned
 me now it's gotten better so obviously they've they've improved their software um but I'm betting
 if I were to slap the the echo back on this tap and run one of those skills I'd I'd be very
 enthusiastic about the data that I'd be receiving
 um okay uh it's being called glitch GLITCH and GL is in caps in in the name of this as in
 web GL a group of researchers at the university in Amsterdam have developed a new startlingly
 effective remote attack against android smartphones using the user's web browser and the device is
 built in GPU via JavaScript and the web GL API so what this means is they have demonstrated
 that a user of android visits a particular website. JavaScript is delivered and runs either
 under Chrome or Firefox it run that they they tested it under both and get this in two minutes
 the attack is so potent that with oh and I should mention this is row hammer uh within two minutes
 their phone is compromised so it's a it's the first row hammer attack to leverage GPUs to leak
 the computers memory contents and allow bad guys remotely to compromise a phone we've talked we've
 been talking about row hammer for quite a while remember that it is a it leverages a essentially
 noise noise in RAM access to cause a bit to flip in the actual memory grid of dynamic RAM
 as a consequence of it it's sort of being a malicious access pattern and it turns out that
 GPUs are far more effective than CPUs the reason we haven't seen this on desktops before is that
 GPUs have their own memory on lower end devices like smartphones and tablets the GPU shares main
 memory with the CPU so by leveraging web GL which gives the JavaScript extremely accurate timing
 information they're able to perform a cache attack with GPU because the GPU has a much shallower
 cache than the CPU does in order to compromise the device within about two minutes so
 what's not clear is whether there has been some fuzzing in the web GL support on those browsers
 they're all there had been some fuzzing in timing in in response to meltdown and specter earlier this
 year under the the cert org page I went looking to see specifically whether Mozilla and and Google
 with Chrome had responded and nothing was there although in digging around I saw some reference to
 perhaps this already having been taken advantage of but nothing yet posted publicly so it's not clear
 certainly both companies know and I'm sure they will be making they will be arranging to limit the
 the timing accuracy of web GL and essentially that's the that's the crucial thing as we have
 been seeing a lot lately to determine whether to for you essentially for row hammer to be used
 to to penetrate caching is you have to be able to sense whether a particular access was was
 cached or not and for that you need to know with very good accuracy what what the timing was so
 anyway we do have again another instance of uh our famously often quoted and I think it was
 Bruce snire who said attacks never get worse they only get better ah trip down memory lane with
 the row hammer attack actually row hammer is an interesting story because once the bad guys
 figured out that you could do those kinds of timing attacks on on hardware and as of course
 as you see even with android uh they they everybody there was a field day for all the security research
 trying to find you know the security flaws from uh timing attacks and I don't think we've seen the
 end of that in even in 2019 I expect many more row hammer style attacks well I think we should
 lighten things up don't you a little bit uh this is uh one of the funnier stories of 2018
 HTTP error 418 no really it's funny listen uh we've actually had Leo a real world occurrence
 of HTTP error 418 I'm a teapot how can I do that now can I make it happen here
 to to to to to our reminder listeners uh it was April 1st not surprisingly of 1998 when
 RFC and Leo you probably want to look this up RFC 23 24 so it's it's it's an it's an official
 I E T F dot org document RFC 23 24 it is the HTC PCP uh protocol which is the hypertext
 coffee pot control protocol and we're we're all familiar with the the infamous uh
 HTTP 404 that's the you know the page not found uh you don't normally see the 300s
 like a 301 or 302 because those are the redirects that's where because you don't see them because
 your browser normally does them for you you click on a link to content that is moved somewhere else
 and what you get back is uh is a 301 redirect which then your browser season goes oh that content is
 over at this URL and it and you go there instead well this introduces the brew method
 you got posts of course but this is brew yes in effect the RFC begins under rationale and scope
 it explains very seriously there is coffee all over the world increasingly in a world
 in which computing is ubiquitous the computers want to make coffee it's also a when method
 so when you're adding milk you can say when oh it says coffee brewing is an art but the
 distributed intelligence of the web connected world transcends art thus there is a strong
 dark rich requirement for a protocol designed espresso Lee espresso Lee espresso Lee
 for the brewing of coffee coffee is brewed using coffee pots networked coffee pots
 require a control protocol if they're to be controlled naturally so the hypertext coffee pot
 control protocol which you have been exploring Leo in the RFC beautiful 23 24 dated April 1st
 1998 so what happened for seven hours yesterday many developers using NPM I'm not kidding
 the node JS package manager yes I use it all the time yes yes we're receiving an error message
 error 418 I'm a teapot the trouble was seen by those teams operating behind a proxy
 that was appending the port specifier colon 443 to the domain name on its way across the proxy
 out onto the public internet well that says say SSL isn't it that's that yeah but it was confusing
 the NPM registries servers which resulted in them returning an error 418 I'm a teapot declaration
 yep somewhere someone decided to return that error for unforeseen conditions
 and it actually did happen in the real world so so great yes I'm a teapot lives
 well past 1998 so awesome Adobe flash cannot die soon enough
 what once again a actively exploited in the wild zero day had come to life they announced
 an emergency patch last Thursday I don't know it's like in other words you know when malware
 you know of flash you would have to say when malware has a large reputable publisher
 I mean that's what this is this is just ridiculous okay so adobe's own summary
 for this update said adobe has released security updates for adobe flash player for windows
 mac ox so mac o s sorry linux and chrome even chrome's built-in flash player was vulnerable
 these updates address critical vulnerabilities in adobe flash player 29.0.0.171 and earlier
 successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution in the context of the current
 user adobe is aware they write of a report that an exploit for and then there's a vulnerability
 for their for their flash player to 2018-5002 exists in the wild and is being used in limited
 targeted attacks against windows users these attacks leverage office documents with embedded
 malicious flash player content distributed via email in some of the coverage of this leo
 I saw some some observers saying well browsers have hardened themselves proactively against
 flash so now the the the the miscreants have figured out another way to leverage the continuing
 existence of flash even those browsers won't use it any longer but it's still present in people's
 systems in order to exploit them and look at this exploitation path i have the the picture
 here in the show notes it's like yikes um the user opens a weaponized office document
 which contains a flash active x embedded object that reaches out to a remote server
 to obtain a flash exploit which is retrieved using public key crypto and and then executed
 which decrypts itself and then in step seven uses a a an exploit in flash load or load bytes
 to load and trigger the exploit which then reaches out again to the same server to download shell
 code which is then able to execute on the user's system so remind me again why it is exactly
 we're waiting until 2020 the end of 2020 through 2020 to finally be rid of this internet menace
 called flash i mean you know we have routers infected half a million routers infected with
 self-destructing firmware ready to be triggered onward from Moscow yet yet you know how difficult
 could it possibly be for adobe to push out just one last update to self-destruct all remaining
 instances of flash in the wild and make everyone safer it's just like my goodness you know it's
 it's only now being used by websites that still want to use it to display video yet we've seen
 that this slow end of lifing doesn't work on the internet it's all and we you know we've we've
 covered multiple instances where chrome it's only by refusing to allow things to run any longer
 that people are creating well published deadlines that people have been forced to move away from
 technology that well you know it's working so let's not change anything except it's it's it's
 presence there is is hurting everyone so anyway i just had to rant again on this another occasion
 of a of of a zero day being exploited by of flash by virtue of the fact that it's it still exists
 in people's machines and what adobe is going to have to do to be responsible i mean i guess we're
 going to have to wait till the end of 2020 but they need to have itself destruct if they're saying
 we're not we're going to no longer support it then please adobe kill it shoot it in the head
 just you know just end of flash goodbye that's what we need uh cedric uh cotchen uh at in macafees
 advanced threat research team uh came up with a clever hack and we've seen things like this leo
 with with voice assistance before where and i'm sure that there have been some some for ios
 where features are added without fully vetting all of the possible ways that they can be abused
 turns out that in windows 10 cortana can be abused um until last tuesday this is another of the
 things that microsoft locked down so um uh this this one is a not a remote problem because it
 involves cortana but a local one it turns out that if you say if you activate uh cortana
 and uh and she comes alive on a locked machine so the machine is is powered on but locked so that
 it's not supposed to do anything turns out cortana is still listening so anyone can come along and
 activate cortana it turns out that you can either either phonetically or use the keyboard to start
 typing you can type while cortana is listening for more verbal command and these guys came up with a
 multi-stage means to make a long story short of running an externally provided power shell script
 from a usb drive that's plugged into the machine that ends up getting registered with a system uh
 cortana is able to see it and when you ask for a search it gets its context its contents are
 indexed which allows you to bring up a file which in this case is a power shell script which is the
 first stage of the attack it's then possible to get that to execute code your own hacker provided
 code from the usb device and uh and go as far as for example completely taking over the locked
 session and even changing the system's password uh on a locked machine the the blog posting that
 mackephie put up uh was titled want to break into a locked windows 10 device ask cortana um so that's
 yet another thing that last tuesday's uh patch round fixed uh fortunately and uh and they noted
 that because they felt that this was you know now it now there's full details published it takes no
 advanced hacking ability in order to to abuse this so um they were suggesting and i would
 absolutely concur uh if you do not update to if for whatever reason you have not updated to last
 tuesday's patches that fix this by all means disable cortana on when the system is locked
 and i would argue that's just sound security practice um there are just too many opportunities
 for this kind of exploit on a system which should just be shut down and not listening
 to anybody while it's locked so i i would say even after having patched the the june updates i
 would that i don't unless you have a compelling need to have cortana listening while your system
 is locked i think it makes a lot of sense to disable that and had you done so already this would
 have never been a vulnerability um i expect there will be uh some people uh getting up to some antics
 uh with this one because it's just it's so easy to do as we know um and this has been in the news
 a lot recently increasingly local police and other law enforcement agencies have been obtaining court
 orders to compel local cell carriers to disclose the location data of of people they suspect of
 crimes um but significantly these have not been probable cause search warrants as permitted
 under the fourth amendment to the u.s. constitution they simply been requests from courts for the
 business record documents of cellular carriers and in previous decisions that it's been um held
 that business records are subject to court order and can be obtained uh by law enforcement for
 whatever purposes they wish okay so um there was a a burglar ring operating uh i think is in 2011
 they were they were caught the ring leader was a guy named timothy ivory carpenter who um
 who was accused of planning these crimes i guess some of his other uh cohorts
 fingered him as the boss and so uh he got in trouble um
 he petitioned uh you know mean they so so he was first convicted uh from oh i i i i should explain
 that the the fbi after they got his name got a court order to cause the cellular carrier in the
 region to turn over the records of his cell phone location which did identify him as being present
 in the location and time of four the burglar burglaries he was found guilty in court
 sentenced and for like a huge number of years more than a several lifetime as i recall um
 he appealed and uh the appeal was heard the appellate court said nope we think this is proper
 so sorry about that and it went to the supreme court that the decision of the supreme court
 uh a day or two ago came down and overturned what the appeals court and the lower courts had said
 and the this was interesting enough and i thought would be interesting enough to our listeners that
 i've pulled together sort of a a summary of this uh because i wanted to go over you know exactly
 what this is that was decided uh chief justice robert delivered the opinion of the court
 um uh and uh from the document which i've excerpted from it reads this case presents the question
 whether the government conducts a search under the fourth amendment when it accesses historical
 cell phone records that provide a comprehensive chronicle of the user's past movements
 um and so okay so i'll skip over what we already know from a technology standpoint
 but i'll just say that it opens with a clear and perfect succinct explanation of cell tower
 location how the increasing popularity of cellular communications has caused providers to increase
 the density of towers and thus increases the accuracy of tower based location approaching that
 of gps especially in urban areas and i do have in the show notes at the beginning of this a link
 to the pdf of the full it's a 158 pages i think it was or that might have been in one of the other
 pds it was like at least 119 of of the opinion anyway so so here's the summary of the decision
 it reads cell phones perform their wide and growing variety of functions by continuously
 connecting to a set of radio antennas called cell sites each time a phone connects to a cell site
 it generates a time stamped record as cell site location information csli wireless carriers
 collect and store this information for their own business purposes here after the fbi identified
 the cell phone numbers of several robbery suspects prosecutors were granted court orders to obtain
 the suspect cell phone records under the stored communications act wireless carriers produced csli
 that is the cell site location information for petitioner timothy carpenters phone and the government
 was able to obtain 12,898 location points cataloging carpenters movements over 127 days
 an average of 101 data points per day carpenter moved to suppress the data arguing that the
 government's seizure of the records without obtaining a warrant that is to say a search warrant
 supported by probable cause violated before the amendment the district court denied the motion
 and prosecutors used the records at trial to show that carpenters phone was near four of the robbery
 locations at the time those robberies occurred carpenter was convicted the sixth circuit affirmed
 holding that carpenter lacked a reasonable expectation of privacy in the location information
 collected by the fbi because he had shared that information with his wireless carriers
 co so what was what what the supreme court held is one the government's acquisition of carpenter
 cell site records was a fourth amendment search they say which is to say qualifies under fourth
 amendment protection and a search warrant with probable cause needed to be obtained in order
 for the cell site records to be had they wrote before the amendment protects not only property
 interests but certain expectations of privacy as well then they cite a previous case cats versus
 the u_s_ thus when an individual quote seeks to preserve something as private unquote and his
 expectation of privacy is quote one that society is prepared to recognize as reasonable unquote
 official intrusion into that sphere generally be generally qualifies as a search and requires
 a warrant supported by probable cause then they cite previous case smith versus maryland
 the analysis regarding which expectations of privacy are entitled to protection
 is informed by historical understandings quote of what was deemed an unreasonable search in seizure
 when the fourth amendment was adopted unquote and again a previous case carol versus u_s_
 these founding era understandings continue to inform this court when applying the fourth
 amendment to innovations in surveillance in surveillance tools then they said next paragraph
 B the digital data at issue which is personal location information maintained by a third party
 does not fit neatly under existing precedence but lies at the intersection of two lines of cases
 one set addresses a person's expectation of privacy in his physical location and movements
 and then they refer to u_s_ versus jones where five justices concluded that privacy concerns
 would be raised by gps tracking then they say the other addresses a person's expectation of privacy
 in information voluntarily turned over to third parties then they cite um u_s_ versus miller
 and also u_s_ versus smith so there's so and this comes back a couple times these smith and miller
 cases where expectation of privacy in records of dialed telephone numbers conveyed to a phone
 company and those were found that those were found not to be protected that is there was no
 expectation in dialing in using a telephone dialing numbers then they say for uh the next paragraph
 C tracking a person's past movements through csli partakes of many of the qualities of gps monitoring
 considered in that jones case where it was decided that gps uh uh tracking uh had privacy concerns
 it is detailed and so so so so they're saying csli partakes of many of the qualities of gps
 monitoring it is detailed encyclopedic and effortless effortlessly compiled at the same time however
 the fact that the individual continuously reveals his location to his wireless carrier implicates
 the third party principle of smith and miller given the unique nature of cell site records this
 court declines to extend smith and miller to cover them a majority of the court has already
 recognized that individuals have a reasonable expectation of privacy in the whole of their
 physical movements allowing government access to cell site records which quote hold for many
 americans the privacies of life unquote and their site riley versus california contravenes that
 expectation in fact historical cell site records present even greater privacy concerns than the gps
 monitoring considered in jones they give the government near perfect surveillance and allow
 it to travel back in time to retrace a person's whereabouts subject only to the five-year retention
 policies of most wireless carriers the government contends that csli data is less precise than gps
 information but it fought the data accurate enough here to highlight it during closing argument
 in carpenters trial at any rate the rule the court adopts must take account of more sophisticated
 systems that are already in use or in development and the accuracy of csli is rapidly approaching
 gps level precision the government contends that the third party doctrine governs this case
 because cell site records like the records of smith and miller are business records created and
 maintained by wireless carriers but there is a world of difference between the limited types
 of personal information addressed in smith and miller that's the the phone dialing and the exhaustive
 chronicle of location information casually collected by wireless carriers the third party
 doctrine the third party doctrine partly stems from the notion that an individual has a reduced
 expectation in information knowingly shared with another smith and miller smith and miller
 however did not rely solely on the act of sharing they also considered the nature of
 the particular documents sought and limitations on any legitimate expectation of privacy concerning
 their contents in mechanically applying the third party doctrine to this case the government fails
 to appreciate the lack of comparable limitations on the revealing nature of csli nor does the
 second rationale for the third party doctrine which is voluntary exposure hold up when it comes
 to csli cell phone location information is not truly shared as the term is normally understood
 first cell phones and the services they provide are quote such a pervasive and
 insistent part of daily life unquote that carrying one is indispensable to participation in modern
 society citing riley uh versus us second a cell phone logs a cell site record by dent of its operation
 without any affirmative act on the users part beyond powering up and so they they trim this a
 little bit saying this decision is narrow it does not express a view on matters not before the court
 does not disturb the application of smith and miller or call into question conventional surveillance
 techniques and tools such as security cameras does not address other business records that
 might incidentally reveal location information and does not consider other collection techniques
 involving foreign affairs or national security the government did not obtain a warrant supported
 by probable cause before acquiring carpenter's cell site records it acquired those records pursuant
 to a court order under the stored communications act which required the government to show reasonable
 grounds for believing that the records were relevant and material to an ongoing investigation
 that showing falls well short of the probable cause required for a warrant
 consequently an order issued under um uh 2703 which is what was cited before is not a permissible
 mechanism for accessing historical cell site records not all orders compelling the production
 of documents will require a showing of probable cause a warrant is required only in the rare case
 excuse me where the suspect has a legitimate privacy interest in records held by a third party
 and even though the government will generally need a warrant to access csli case specific exceptions
 for example exigent circumstances may support a warrantless search and they provide some some
 sightings reversed and remanded so bottom line uh and good news for individuals in my opinion
 is that uh the supreme court ruled that that the the acquisition of csli data that is the the
 entire history of an individual cell cell phone movement back through time as far back as five
 years can only be acquired by law enforcement if they have probable cause and are able to get a
 search warrant from a court in order to uh request the uh the acquisition of those records from the
 cell carrier so i think the supreme court did us right in this case and i'm glad that um that
 this will happen we've there have been recently an an increasing number of instances i don't think
 i've talked about it on the podcast but i've i've i've encountered it in in reading where uh law
 enforcement is just making sweeping requests for for cell phone location information uh without
 you know just asking a court to say hey uh we're able to have this so from now on they'll need to
 show probable cause before before getting it and i think that's probably a good thing
 hey if i could interrupt just for a moment every year we do this and we thought this would be a
 good time of the year uh to do our annual survey kind of a gift if you will to us if you like what
 we have done every once in a while we do these surveys we try to get to know our audience better
 and since your techies this one focuses particularly on uh if and how you might use collaborative
 software at work that's we're trying to find out right now this is a very short survey six minutes
 at best probably a lot faster we and i i know this is so important to security analysis so i
 really want to underscore this we do not collect any personal data for it we're only from it we're
 only looking for uh general sense uh from our audience so here it is if you've got a moment it
 would be a gift to us thank you twit.to/survey12 okay we'll wait a few minutes while you do that
 no we're not gonna do that you but when you get a chance you can do all your listening right and
 meanwhile back to the best of first time steves ever let us do this the best of security now 2018
 happy holidays everybody from everybody the twits staff well we have a great crew
 they work hard but we have to give them a little time off on the holidays so we thought we'd do a
 security now best of even forcing steve to take some time off i bet you he's not i bet you he's
 writing the next episode we do security now every tuesday 130 pacific 430 eastern time 2030 utc
 21 30 utc and i hope you'll come by we won't be here january first it's new year's day but we
 will be back january 8th and uh i suspect the security flaws will be back as well the next segment
 is uh something we talked a lot about on all this shows kind of a problem uh when you wear a fitness
 tracker sometimes it's possible to see where you are there was a big problem at the pentagon and
 then the nsa got into the act watch um our our listeners will recall that i think it was in 2016
 we talked about the the strava fitness tracking app which was just sort of publishing all of the
 positioning information of its users because everyone kind of thought that would be cool
 to look at maps of where people were using their app unfortunately it turned out that there were
 people on secret military bases going out for a jog around camp who were being logged and
 you know satellite looking maps had this strava uh fitness tracking data overlaid on it and suddenly
 there was a little sort of suspicious a lot of activity in areas of the desert where nothing was
 shown on the maps and so anyway we talked about it at the time well it turns out that some investigations
 carried out by reporters from a dutch newspaper uh day correspondent and uh online investigations
 group belling cat have found another instance which caused polar uh the well known um i think
 they're dutch aren't they um no uh no not i don't remember polar is finish finish finish yeah that's
 right yeah um so they call they have what what they found has caused polar to suspend its global
 activity mapping feature it's kind of not polar's fault but well anyway so here's what happened
 the two groups of reporters discovered that polar flow which is one of polar's apps was allowing
 anyone access to a feature called explore which is polar's activity map the data exposed on this map
 included a user's past activity you know running biking routes and so forth but included the user
 the user's personal details such as their heart rate various fitness attributes and more
 um uh well what polar did was they made the mistake of exposing the username and personal
 details of each individual for each individual activity and route um and it upon digging into
 it deeper it looks like the user needs to explicitly allow that information to be shared but they
 probably didn't understand fully the consequences the reporters tracked down were able to thanks to
 this disclosure the real world identities of specific intelligence and military personnel
 the journalist used this feature to search the map for the location of known military bases
 and intelligence agencies headquarters and training grounds they were then able to identify
 the people who reported fitness activity history at those locations and in several cases
 the researchers were able to identify the user names which led back to real world identities
 either because the military and intelligence agents used their real names for the polar app
 or because they reused user names that were associated with them elsewhere and the
 reporters were able to make the connections um oh and also in in in some cases the same routes which
 they ran while jogging on base also contained the jogging and biking routes in other locations
 for the same person which then allowed that linkage exposing what looked like their users home address
 so again in response to these revelations polar immediately shut down the global
 activity mapping feature but they then did seek to clarify that this polar flow app
 does not expose the user's activity and username by default polar said that these details are shared
 only based on an opt-in system and the data exposed via its activity map had to be willingly shared
 only by or had had to be and was being shared only by some of its users with the majority of
 their users data remaining private so i guess i would say that this is clearly
 a privacy concern and anybody who is is is using this really needs to have it be made clear i mean
 there's there's some tension here right polar much like strava wants to
 brag about how many people are using their their stuff it's every it's people all over the world
 look at how busy everybody is getting fit and healthy um the flip side is i mean there it is
 an information disclosure and so people i think who are saying you know yes i i want to
 you know others to be able to see my little red lines where i'm running and or my username
 and other data i want to share that really need to be made aware of the the downside consequences
 from a privacy standpoint i don't think you can blame blame polar flow for that i mean you yeah
 maybe it's good for polar to show many people use their app but that's the point of it is is uh and
 you know apples does the same thing with their activity rings you can share with other people
 and then you compete with them and so forth um do you share it um with specific people in the
 apple case though yeah because this was because this was shared globally yeah but this was a global
 and so there were two things that were wrong i mean there clearly if you're an nsa intelligence
 officer and you're publicly sharing your run route you need to be kind of go back to school and
 learn some upset that's right but uh there seems to have also been a problem you were absent for
 that day yeah of training when you said uh what uh uh but you know i mean it's actually not a surprise
 there's a lot of military folks in great shape and so they're exercising so you know clearly they're
 at fault for making it public the problem really also was there was an api that was exposing this
 and they used sequential index numbers for customers so you could just query the api and get this
 information and that's clearly polar's fault that's so a poor a poor design from an anatomy uh and
 anonymizing stamp yeah yeah but uh i mean there's lots of apps that you know runkeeper does this too
 where you share your run and people like to do that and they like to you know so yeah they probably
 shouldn't be doing it if they're in a secret location uh probably not if your location should
 not be disclosed especially since this whole thing came up already and you know yes exactly two
 years ago it made the news and it couldn't have been even even any more specific it was a running
 program it was exactly the same right so wanna cry oh man refuses to die this is the last year version
 too gosh yeah so uh as we'll remember wanna cry was the uh uh the the weaponization
 of a flaw in version two of windows smb the server message block also known as windows file
 and printer sharing um that was believed well we know that it was leaked by the shadow brokers
 we believe it was an internal nsa exploit originally named eternal blue so it was it so eternal blue
 was taken and weaponized as ron as wannick ri which was a a very very destructive uh crypto malware
 which was the uh the thing that let us spread over the network right that was yeah the the smb
 exactly it was it was the the the the propagation mechanism here's my t so i tell you you go up to
 girl and you say it pro tv and chill if she doesn't say yes she's not the right woman
 i'm just sad no all right okay the good news is with that t-shirt she can really see you coming
 it's a little red all right so sorry uh it's struck again over the weekend it's expected to shave a
 quarter billion dollars from a major taiwanese semiconductor manufacturers revenue as a consequence
 of it bringing down bringing to a halt multiple semiconductor manufacturing fabrication facilities
 across taiwan uh the company is that cleverly named taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company
 we just call it t_s_m_c_ t_s_m_c_ uh not only is it a major supplier of parts for apple a_m_d_ and
 vidia and qualcom but it's taiwan's largest company so big guys i didn't know why wow yeah they make
 the a11 ship for the iphones and ipads right right and so there was some concern that this would be
 a supply chain glitch for maybe apple and others it's unclear i mean it was it was relatively
 short i mean they were able to get things back up but they but they wrote this virus outbreak
 occurred due to misoperation during the software installation process for a new tool
 which caused a virus to spread once the tool was connected to the company's computer network
 so yeah um now uh uh so it's taken a chunk out of their revenue although they're there you know a
 major uh company they're forecasting revenue in the quarter to be a rat was there original
 forecast was eight point four five billion dollars so i'm knowing that it was eight point five five
 so it's expected to drop by at least 200 billion to eight point four five so anyway uh it's anyway
 so they're they're saying the revenue hit could be as high as 256 million in other words a quarter
 billion but still you know they're eight and a half billion so they'll be okay um but what's
 interesting is it's not clear how this happened because it didn't just spread you know it destroyed
 their systems it encrypted their systems and uh and we'll remember that it was our friend of the
 podcast Marcus Hutchins aka malware tech who who was looking at this immediately upon its
 appearance on the internet and saw in the code that for some reason this wanna cry malware was
 was checking for it was making a DNS query and so but the DNS domain that it was querying was
 unregistered so all of these queries were coming back as no such domain name so he thought huh
 wonder what that's about and he registered the domain name and immediately wanna cry stopped
 and so what we what we surmise is that this was a a deliberate kill switch which was put into the
 malware by its authors as a means for them to shut it down if for some reason they wanted to
 well it's still in place and the the as we know uh you know I coined the term internet background
 radiation to talk about the fact that there are many of these worms code red and nimda still live
 on some systems and they're out there pinging around looking for new victims uh similarly wanna
 cry is still out looking for other systems to and to encrypt but its check for that DNS domain is
 succeeding which prevents it from doing so so uh we don't know about the details of this uh this
 Taiwanese manufacturer TSMC's internal network but it might be that they've got strict controls over
 DNS what DNS queries are allowed to be made to public DNS servers or they might have some sort of
 you know border protection that's pre that's preventing all but some explicitly white listed
 domains we don't know but what we do know based on the information we have is that if this was
 monocry it would not have done anything if it had been able to get resolution of that DNS so
 maybe it was a variation of wanna cry that has had the kill switch neutered so as not to use it any
 longer no one knows you know really what happened but anyway that's that's the story is that this
 thing wanna cry is still uh you know delivering its destructive payload you know wherever it can
 and at least this instance the hacker news reported on some research that the AP the associated press
 did which it's probably this is maybe a little inflammatory clickbait but it's worth pointing
 out to our listeners uh the statement was google tracks you everywhere even if you explicitly tell
 it not to and there is some truth to it uh what the AP found is that preventing google from acquiring
 long-term tracking data requires more than turning off the obvious location history function
 what what what the hacker news wrote was every time a service like google maps wants to use your
 location google asks your permission to allow access to your location if you want to use it for
 navigating they say but a new navigation but i'm sorry but a new investigation shows that the company
 does track you anyway the AP revealed that many google services on android and iphone devices
 store records of your location data even when you have paused the location history on your mobile
 device disabling location history in the privacy settings of google applications should prevent
 it is argued google from keeping track of your every movement as its own support page states quote
 you can turn off location history at any time with location history off the places you go are
 no longer stored that's not true as the AP explains quote from the AP for example google stores a
 snapshot of where you are when you merely open its maps app automatic daily weather updates on
 android phones pinpoint roughly where you are and some searches that have nothing to do with
 location like chocolate chip cookies and kids science kits pinpoint your precise latitude and
 longitude they write accurate to the square foot and save it to your google account during
 their coverage to demonstrate the threat of this what they consider i mean again clickbait but
 worth understanding of this google practice the AP created a visual map of the movements of
 a Princeton postdoctoral researcher uh uh doctor a car who carried an android smartphone with
 location history switched off to prevent location data collection however the researcher discovered
 that the map includes records of doctor a car's train commute on two trips to new york and visits
 to high line park Chelsea market hell's kitchen central park and harlem to protect the privacy
 of doctor a car the publication did not plot the most telling and frequent marker on the map
 his home address according to the researchers this privacy issue affects around two billion
 android users and hundreds of millions of iphone users across the world who rely on google maps
 or search in response to the ap's investigation google issued the following statement quote
 there are a number of different ways that google may use location to improve people's experience
 including location history web and app activity and through device level location services
 they say we provide clear descriptions of these tools and robust controls so people can turn
 them on or off and delete their histories at any time uh jonathan mayor whom we've uh spoken of years
 past uh often a Princeton researcher and former chief technologist for the fcc's enforcement
 bureau argued if you're going to allow users to turn off something called location history
 then all the places where you maintain location history should be turned off
 he says that seems like a pretty straightforward position to have so for what it's worth to stop
 google from saving time stamped location markers users need to turn off another setting and that's
 that web and act and web and app activity which is enabled by default and stores a variety of
 information from google apps and sites to your google account once disabled it will not only stop
 google from storing location markers but also prevents the company from storing information
 generated by searchers searches and other activities so anyway uh if i just wanted to point this out
 it seemed a little over the top in the the way it was being described but it's certainly reasonable
 if somebody wasn't really paying attention and thought that just turning off location history
 shut that down completely you also need to go into your google account
 and turn off web and app activity which does not just record activity but where that activity
 occurred hope you're enjoying our best of security now we're taking a couple of weeks off
 as i mentioned we'll be back january 8th i bet you that steve is not playing fortnite right now
 but a lot of you are i mean really isn't it a fortnite christmas uh except on android where
 fortnite turns out to be surprisingly hackable uh last week we talked about they the so-called
 man in the disc attacks again maybe it was next last week of the week before anyway in the last
 couple weeks um this was the vulnerability which had come to light where many apps were staging
 themselves in external storage uh which many android devices have it's it's a shared resource
 and that i mean it's that sharing of the resource that creates the problem because many apps have
 access overlapping access to that shared resource creating the so-called man in the disc attacks
 so it turns out that the extremely popular um first person is a first person shooter leo i've
 never looked at what it actually is i just know it's battle royale you go in and a hundred other
 people go in and last man standing wins yeah okay kind of a first person shooter special
 so yeah so google takes a 30 cut of all revenue generated by apps downloaded through the google
 play store and as uh you have often observed on the twit network leo i've heard you talking
 about fortnite actually it's about fortnite itself is free but they make money like a ton of money
 selling other stuff in the game yeah so over on ios with uh where fortnite has a player base of
 it's estimated between 125 and 150 million users so i think that i think that's maybe across both
 platforms during the first ten days of season five the ioe the ios release netted epic games the
 publisher of fortnite two million dollars per day two million dollars per day so the total mobile
 revenue on ios between its march 15th release in the end of july was 150 million dollars um
 since there's no other method of distributing apps in the apple ecosystem other than the apple store
 epic games had no choice but to hand over a piece of their action to apple but not so on android
 epic games has elected to bypass google and the play store and to teach how to and encourage people
 because there's no other way to obtain this latest fortnite how to sideload fortnite by downloading
 an apk from fortnite's own website so this of course requires instructing people to push past
 all the sideloading warnings present on android devices and the big worry among the security
 community is that this could have the effect of encouraging and normalizing the sideloading process
 and behavior and pave the way to additional fortnite clone malware and of course we've
 previously talked about how fort there were fortnite cheat add-ons that have been malicious and have
 hurt people um so it turns out that on top of this that is that fortnite has decided to sideload
 in order to not give google a piece of their substantial action on the android platform
 because it's possible um fortnite is one of the apps vulnerable to this man in the disc attack
 that we've been talking about which the researchers at checkpoint recently made clear um google
 maybe being a little miffed at fortnite for encouraging sideloading did not give epic a 90
 day window to fix after it became after it came to light that the fortnite installer was vulnerable
 to hijacking through man of the disc attacks um in there in google's posting they wrote the fortnite
 apk which is calm.epicgames.fortnite is downloaded by the fortnite installer to external storage
 and then i've in the show notes i just clipped out a chunk of of directory listing showing uh
 the all of the entries there and then google continues saying any app with the right external
 storage permission can substitute the apk immediately after the download is completed and the fingerprint
 is verified they write google writes this is easily done using a file observer the fortnite
 installer will proceed to install the substituted fake apk on samsung devices the fortnite installer
 performs the apk install silently via a private galaxy apps api this api checks that the apk being
 installed has the package name calm.epicgames.fortnite but does nothing else consequently the fake apk
 with a matching packet name package name can be silently installed if the fake apk has a target
 sdk version of 22 or lower it will be granted that as this potentially malicious fake apk
 will be granted all permissions it requests at install time this vulnerability allows an app
 on the device to hijack the fortnite installer to instead install a fake apk with any permissions
 that would normally require user disclosure okay so in response unhappily epic but immediately epic
 released version 2.1 and as i said epic is clearly unhappy with google's short notice they said in
 actual is Tim Sweeney at epic who tweeted we asked google to hold the disclosure until the update
 was more widely installed you can see why that's not going to happen though uh-huh yes uh i should
 a minute because it's out there it's happening exactly exactly so they so uh Tim Tim uh said
 they refused they google refused creating an unnecessary risk for android users in order to
 score cheap PR points is what Tim at epic tweeted google defended google defended their timing saying
 that their own instrumentation had shown that most fortnite users had already updated to version 2.1
 so anyway the much has been made of of this uh and uh a lot of coverage in the press
 has has been unhappy with epic's decision i mean it's difficult to be when you consider the amount
 of money that epic is talking about on the other hand they're only making the money because google
 has created the platform and i think you're risking your customers safety to make some more money and
 no was there already an exploit in the wild i mean it seems to me that the reason google had to
 go public well i don't know i mean it is to tell people to stop sideloading or maybe there wasn't
 there were no exploits going on well well this doesn't prevent sideloading it was that fortnite
 loader no i understand but i mean the reason they exposed it is because people were actively
 at risk right now right yes yes yes exactly yes i mean there were there people taking my sense
 was that were already it had already happened that there were some it was essentially a zero day yeah
 yes so you got to tell people so they stopped doing it until it's fixed yes yes yes and and
 immediately get the word out i mean imagine if google didn't tell anybody and people were getting
 affected right and left oh well we wanted responsible disclosure so that the epic could fix it well
 that's not responsible that's irresponsible i think right yeah epic's just chopped cheese because they
 did the wrong thing and they got bit well and you know as we talked about when we were talking about
 this whole man of the disc problem google does clearly state that for example app should do what epic
 2.1 now does which we are exactly now does but they've always said this you know that if you're
 going to use external storage make very sure that you're actually installing the the apk or whatever
 it is you know like that you can trust what it is that is in that store and epic just wasn't they
 were like oh there's no download and some more fortnight stuff and let's just suck it right in and
 you know this really did open them to the hack and of course the security community is upset because
 the problem is this you know sideloading is dangerous because you are training people to push past
 all of the warnings that google has saying uh you know we haven't been able to check this we don't
 know what this is you're loading you you need to be really sure and here epic is widely distributing
 to to i mean you know tens of millions if not more users their app not only was it insecure but they're
 they're encouraging the circumvention of the google play store so you're interested to see how this
 plays out sonar scoop uh snoop snoop oh snoop yeah you see why do i yeah you and i both did that no i
 totally did it before the show i was what is the sooner i think it corrected the sooner scoop which
 for the sooners uh it was a sports site and i was like i just for the Oklahoma sooners football
 team and i was like this is not right so i'll tell you this is this is the best time of year
 for the podcast because we've got the usenix conference and we've got black hat and deaf
 con i mean it is just security conference heaven uh so this is another piece of research that was
 shown at the three weeks ago now baltimore usenix security conference um in the show notes i have
 a picture from their research pdf which they published as part of the the conference proceedings
 it shows the back of a samson galaxy s4 with the microphone that you would uh with with the
 microphone at the top of the phone and the speaker on the back oh i'm sorry the the microphone at
 the bottom that you normally talk to and they'll and a speaker at the bottom and then on the on
 the other picture is a my is a top located microphone and a top located speaker so the top one is where
 your ear normally is and you obviously the bottom microphone is where your mouth normally is but
 for to to increase noise cancellation uh and the the utility of the phone they put both the microphone
 and a speaker also on the opposite ends so you've got a top microphone a top speaker a bottom microphone
 and a bottom speaker well the next page of the show notes i show their simplified diagram of what
 that means that means you can ping from the top speaker a ultrasonic sound that the user will not
 hear which will be received after some length of time based on how far away the person is and the
 the rate at which sound travels will be heard by the upper microphone similarly you can ping from
 the bottom speaker and it will bounce off the underside of the user's finger and back into the
 bottom microphone in other words classic sonar and now to triangulate you really would want
 the sensors to be mounted on adjacent corners of the area that way if you get you if you take the
 two distances you know so so they're on it's called triangulate because there the two sensors will lie
 on one edge of a triangle and then the distance that they're each sensing uh informs it of the
 this the length of the other two lengths of the triangle allowing it to uniquely determine
 the apex of the triangle not containing the sensors thus triangulation we don't have that
 here we've got you know kind of arbitrarily located sensors so it's less than ideal but their research
 demonstrates that they are able to to not perfectly but to significantly determine the instantaneous
 position of a user's finger which is in contact with the screen so so so reading from their abstract
 at the top of their research they said we report the first active acoustic side channel attack
 speakers are used to emit human inaudible acoustic signals you know like bats and the echo
 is recorded via microphones turning the acoustic system into a smartphone sonar system the echo
 signal can be used to profile user interaction with the device or example a victim's finger movements
 can be inferred to steal android unlock patterns in our empirical study the number of candidate
 unlock patterns that an attacker must try to authenticate herself to a samsung s4 phone
 can be reduced by up to 70 percent using this novel acoustic side channel so no not reduced
 to zero but you know it's reduced by more than half the attack is entirely unnoticeable to victims
 our approach they write can be easily applied to other application scenarios and device types
 overall our work highlights a new family of security threats so in terms of details
 they they used a dictionary of 12 unlock patterns okay so not the not the universe of
 possible unlock patterns they just you know they were looking for does this kind of work at all
 so they they used a dictionary of 12 unlock patterns in their tests which contained 15 unique
 strokes the data collected from 12 volunteers uh was fed into a into into an AI learning machine
 model for classification of each stroke and as expected the classification accuracy was
 significantly higher when input simultaneous input from both micro microscopes was can microphones
 was considered the researchers reduced the average number of correct candidates
 from the 12 unlock patterns to 3.6 that's average in some instances the analysis eliminated all
 guesses and revealed the single correct pattern uniquely I looked at the research and I won't go
 into any more detail here because everybody gets it but I have a strong gut sense that we're going
 to see this evolve this it's it uses sensors available in our devices it could certainly be used for
 benign purpose like you know moving your hand around in front of an app in order to do something
 and having the app respond it's not super high fidelity again the sensors are not located
 exactly where you want them where was it the apple when it was a the amazon phone they had like
 some funky sensor in each corner of the screen for a while didn't they Jason and they yeah
 and that was meant to kind of change the parallax of of what you were looking at it was it was
 meant to kind of like you know from the four points be able to know where in your perspective
 and shift accordingly so like to to see your face so that they could change the screen in order to
 make it look more depthy it was a lot of hardware for our very minimal application purpose but no
 what this reminds me of is if you remember it was like three or four years ago google io google
 had shown off something called project solely which was also like yes yes yes and i am so jazz
 by that where you like you do like you know like like push buttons and turn knobs and things oh
 yeah i really want to see that happen i haven't really heard much about it since then and i think
 their their idea was that it would possibly be integrated into like wearables like smartwatches
 of some sort so that you wouldn't have to touch it but you could still do the controls
 and then there's also something else that i read about called what was it it was called finger
 io which there's a demonstration and that that's that seems a little bit more in line with what
 sonar snoop is all about yeah and uh uh uh solely was uh em radiation so it was it was it was very
 low level electromagnetic radiation that gave it extremely high resolution in return for having to
 have a lot of processing behind it but but anyway this is i thought this was very cool very clever
 something no one had thought of before and i wouldn't be surprised if we see this uh evolving in the
 future this feels like something that uh could be taken from this initial research out to its next
 level so uh props to these guys at a nice piece of research yeah no matter what you call it i'm
 curious on a on a device specific perspective because like you were saying you know every every
 phone has a microphone and a speaker in a different location and so you know for this to work on a
 broad spectrum of android devices like i imagined those locations like create different hurdles as
 far or different requirements for where exactly on the screen your finger is at any given moment
 if the speakers and microphones are over here versus over there does that then narrow down you
 know the accuracy differently and so for example one one thing that's if somebody wanted to be clever
 they could create a game which which you know inherently requires you to move your finger around
 and touch different areas of the screen oh to learn why yes while you're playing the game it's doing
 sonar on you and you don't know it's calibrating yes yep that's that dang it that's that's too wise
 that's too smart and you know what that'll probably happen but this only really from a security standpoint
 it seems like this really only works if you're doing like a swipe pattern right would it would
 it be would there be any indication that it would work with like tapping in a pin or something
 along and that and that's exactly what i mean when i say this feels like first gen yeah and so
 you know they demonstrated the concept is viable and so i wouldn't be surprised if before long they
 could turn this in to read you know read keystrokes on a keyboard totally well that's another thing
 that's kind of reminded me of the whole thread from years ago about uh people being able to listen
 to someone typing on a keyboard uh and being able to reconstruct what they're typing based on the
 sound of those keys clapping yeah that's just bizarre but it's true yeah yeah oh the stuff is
 crazy i think the thing that has received the the least attention but it is certainly significant
 about this facebook breach when you hear 50 million accounts were compromised and and they've and
 another 40 like one level removed may also have been you sort of think oh look you know like mass
 mass collection breach of some sort you know that's what we're used to like when a when a web
 service loses its database it's well you know how many of just like randomly chosen records out of
 total got loose what's significant about this is that uh this particular breach
 was absolutely targetable by its nature and in fact uh uh um Mark Zuckerberg and uh uh Cheryl
 Sandberg's accounts were both targeted uh and potentially compromised so so the point is that
 that the people who discovered this had to do a lot of work it's a it's a
 sophisticated attack um it means so so somebody was poking at facebook for some period of time
 because facebook is facebook and the the ability to perform the attack
 occurred in july of 2017 right so like 17 18 i guess months ago 17 months ago um so um quite
 a while ago that's been there for all this time the only way this account what the breach was
 discovered was a a side effect of the way it works is people apparently logging in and and
 essentially what you're able to do and i'll explain a little bit you know what we know of how
 you're able to cause an unauthenticated login of someone else in order to bring their login
 token current and it was the the sudden increase in the background continuous and certainly high
 level of that happening but it suddenly spiked and so the facebook people said you know the
 engineers said wait a minute why uh are we suddenly seeing a dramatic increase in the rate of people
 logging in and that's what tipped it off but we don't know over like over what period of time
 this thing occurred and and it was and the point is that it's completely stealthful
 unless someone notices that like by looking at their own account wait a minute somebody logged in
 from somewhere else and and left a breadcrumb behind or uh or something gets changed okay so
 the the crux of this is a is a feature that's sort of scary but it's also certainly useful i remember
 i guess i was if it's when i was playing with my with trying to get a hold of and under get a
 handle on the way facebook's view viewability stuff works as i said leo i i do have a facebook
 page i don't use it i don't think there's anything posted on there um but i need i but i created the
 account in order to see other people's and also when i wanted to explore the facebook privacy and
 security settings because i've talked about them a couple times and so certainly one of the things
 that is very useful because in any in any in any environment where you want to curate who can see
 what is you want to test that you want to view your own page as if you were someone else and
 well that's impersonation and it turns out that facebook understood that this was dangerous and so
 but they also understood they needed to offer the the feature so you've always had
 this view as feature which would allow you to to cause facebook to show your page as if you were
 someone else and you get to specify whom so if you said with this if you said i want to see mark
 zuckerberg's view of my facebook page on some level there's been the invocation of mark zucker
berg's identity into like viewing your facebook page so so that was part of this is that is this
 the way view as works then it turns out that there's a a video tool a video upload capability
 which allows you to send somebody like a you know like a birthday greeting upload a video and it's
 it's that tool which which acquired a bug in july of 2017 which caused it to incorrectly manage
 the identity tokens that it was having to juggle in the the authentication of the of different
 people such that the bad guys were able to to in a multi-factor
 attack to leverage view as and the mistake in this video upload tool in order to obtain a current
 logged in authentication token for and here it is anyone they want it which is what makes this
 so scary is this thing has been in there has been in place since july of 2017 we don't know
 that it hasn't been used that it hasn't been known who knows how many mysterious breaches or
 people's pages being changed or mischief or what has been gotten up to during that time because
 again it wasn't you know zuckerburgs was compromised sharrows account was compromised so clearly
 before they began a much higher speed wholesale rifling they were going after high profile targets
 it seems so that's now been closed facebook has understanding the nature of the breach
 is able to go back in their logs see this being done and then what happened on friday was that
 50 million people actually 90 million people suddenly found themselves logged out of facebook
 and it was like you know because then and everyone's used to like facebook leaving you
 persistently logged in because it's convenient well and as we know what that means is that that you
 have a cookie in in the form of an authentication token from facebook which your browser presents
 whenever it it pulls any resource from facebook which authenticates you as being logged in
 as as you on this browser so those were all all of those authentication tokens were immediately
 invalidated and consequently people had the login again um now the the reason the sort of the other
 shoe here to drop is that it's bad enough that a bad guy could obtain an authenticated session
 for anyone they wanted now that that's what this means i mean for since july of 2017
 if anybody who knew about this could obtain a valid logged in session for anyone they wanted
 but what that means by extension is that the now unfortunately very popular login with facebook
 can be abused because it means that your browser contains a valid facebook login token for for
 anybody you have targeted which means when you log in with your facebook account you're logging
 in with their facebook account meaning that you're able to log into any other third party service
 that where they have an account recognized by facebook so for example under single sign on or
 of single sign on in wired magazines coverage of this they said the debacle also underscores
 broader concerns about single sign on which friday turned into the ultimate object lesson in the
 inherent trade-offs between security and convenience can white the director of the open crypto audit
 project said single sign on schemes are great but the downside is if a single sign on gets breached
 you're hosed um so wired says sticking with a single more secure sign in does make sense
 especially for use on sites that don't have the resources or inclination to invest heavily in
 security development actually none of that's true but because i mean that because well anyway
 but just like you want your passwords to be unique so compromising one doesn't expose them all
 account diversity is also vital online no matter how ironclad a particular sign-in scheme is
 then they said quote you don't want a situation where there's one breach and your entire online
 identity is gone says uh the same guy uh can white so anyway that's what happened it was it was
 longstanding it was i mean and again that this is it's hard to do what facebook is doing at the
 scale they're doing it the i would argue that view as is necessary and terrifying i mean it is
 and is inherently it is inherently a horrifying from us from a implementers you know security
 standpoint i mean it is a real pucker factor because boy you know you really got to get it right
 and it looks like largely they did but in one place they missed something and someone found a
 little way to wedge themselves in and leverage something which is i mean and facebook obviously
 is as we all know is really staggering at the moment under or been like you know you've deleted
 you just said it Leo you've deleted your facebook account i mean they're they've been staggering
 under all kinds of of privacy issues as a consequence of being you know what is it two billion users
 two and a half and being so two yeah being so popular so um and oh i i i i would argue against
 Zuckerberg who said uh he called it a arms race it's like no i mean you know i mean it's hard
 to get it right i absolutely agree and here i empathize with them that that you know if you're
 going to have the ability to show different classes of users different views of you of your
 content then you need to be able to audit that which means you need to be able to say
 what would so-and-so see of my page and it's like yeah yeah yeah yeah okay uh you know scary
 but but it is actually a perfect example of i mean i already hate OAuth can i consider it a
 horrific collage because as we as we know and we've talked about users don't understand that when
 you log in with google or log in with facebook or log in with twitter or whatever the reason those
 services are happy to provide this referral service is they're tracking you they're they're
 knowing everywhere you're logging in and adding it to their compilation of your profile and you're
 giving you know you're updating your information about them and and as we've just now seen if that
 service suffers a breach anywhere you have used them you're now subject to you know i mean you
 they they've extended the blast radius beyond their own perimeter to everywhere else so anyway
 it's one of the reasons why when i first told us all about squirrel years ago i said it's a two-party
 solution it is it's secure single factor you know it's like you don't the only reason you need
 multi-factor is none of them are secure enough so you need lots of them in order to increase the
 to increase the security if you have secure one factor then it's all you need and the beauty of
 it is it's just two-party the problem with this log in as is you're bringing in a third party
 which and here's an example of it going wrong so anyway that's what happened with facebook
 and again i i don't think i i'm not saying oh this is a a glaring problem i mean i would argue
 that's the the the reason they're already in hot water those are clearly that has been
 facebook's policy problems that have come home to roost here this was a really obscure bug
 and anybody can make a mistake you know they did they did get it fixed quickly and to our listeners
 i would say take this opportunity to go use the facebook tool which they provide of where has
 have logins to your account occurred from which devices and from which locations just make sure
 you recognize them all because that's worth doing and also you know eliminate any applications
 that you've given permission to use your facebook account that you're no longer using as we've said
 that kind of periodic audit can be a good thing to do yeah maybe this is just a wake up call
 is there a safe way to use single sign-on solutions like that oauth solutions
 um we the problem is users are not given enough control right there ought to be a way
 to evoke the otherwise persistent relationship that is that is connect of the connection between
 the the authentication token that you give the third party and the site you're visiting
 facebook did also uh kill all of those those referral tokens essentially which was good
 but but it's the problem is it's done behind the scenes and it's so it's it's
 meant to make the system easy to use but because because users are not given visibility into it
 it's not something it's it's easy to do it's better just not to have it in the first place
 used to be you could do your own oauth i remember you could have your own site but
 i don't know how that would work if a site didn't know about it yeah remember you're able to put a
 token on a page on your server and bounce and bounce you through that would be so much better
 i guess it wouldn't help average the average joe but yeah yeah that's the problem the average
 joe is going to have a solution here pretty soon that's called squirrel squirrel did google hide a
 quote major unquote google plus security flaw that exposed users personal information
 the headlines about this were breathless yeah uh google hid major google plus security flaw that
 exposed users personal information google plus shutting down after bug leaks info of five hundred
 thousand accounts google to shut down google plus after failing to disclose user data breach
 google is shutting down google plus after a secret potential data leak google plus to shut down after
 cover-up of data exposing bug okay so what happened um given what google's own security research
 auditors found which is who found this back in march and given all of the deliberately privacy
 constrained information google had at their disposal which is not much because they were
 deleting it on purpose to protect users i think they've acted responsibly and appropriately
 the the controversy here is that the wall street journal caught wind of this
 of this discovery of theirs back in march which google fixed because there and didn't say anything
 about at the time because google despite looking for any evidence that anybody else
 knew of this bug was unable to find it since their logs were incomplete they they didn't they
 couldn't be absolutely sure it had never been used but they had no reason to believe it had been
 so uh yesterday uh the uh the vp of engineering posted under project strobe
 says that the the posting is protecting your data improving our third party apis and sun setting
 consumer google plus and of course we've talked about google plus i know you guys
 are used to love it yeah yeah but you know kind of just was one of those things that
 never got off the ground that was there you know they really put all their uh all the wood
 behind the arrows there uh they even gave people um bonuses one year based on google's uh social
 success because they were trying to stop facebook but it just it didn't take off and then once
 something neglected as any social network does it became spam and porno yep yep uh and very much
 like my space which is like yeah okay yeah so from their announcement i pulled a few relevant bits
 so they they wrote at the beginning of this year we started an effort called project strobe
 a root and branch and i'm thinking what is that like soup to nuts i guess so but that's
 a root and a corporate term of art that's what that review of third party developer
 access to google account and android device data and of our philosophy around apps data access
 so that's all good this project they wrote looked at the operation of our privacy controls
 platforms where users were not engaging with our apis because of concerns around data privacy
 areas where developers may have been granted overly broad access and other areas in which our
 policy should be tightened so like you know a very what we want from google focused self-imposed
 audit of their stuff so they say they continue our review showed that our google plus apis
 and the associated controls for consumers are challenging to develop and maintain i don't really
 i don't didn't dig in enough to know what that means that sounds like you know corporate speak
 for we didn't do it right or it's it's hard to do it right i don't know apis are hard
 yeah tell me anyway underlying this underlying this as part of our project strobe audit we discovered
 a bug in one of the google plus people apis okay so now here's what we know they wrote users can
 grant access to their profile data and the public profile information of their friends to google
 plus apps via the api the bug meant that apps also had access to profile fields that were shared
 with the user but not marked public so this was these were meant to be kept private so they were
 user provided fields that were that the user was not meant that did not intend to share publicly
 i'll give you an example what those are because as soon as this came out i went to my google plus
 profile which i set up ages ago and there's mostly public stuff your links your you know
 stuff and there were two things in there that were private one was my personal phone number
 and one was my address i have no idea why i put my personal phone number and address in there
 uh because it weren't publicly viewable but maybe there was something i think it may have been for
 account recovery at the time could be or there were layers of sharing i think there were i can't
 remember so worst case i mean nobody's putting a credit card number in there worst case yes and
 actually you can't right uh google explains this data is limited to static optional google plus
 profile fields and they said including name email address occupation gender and age
 then in their posting they gave a full link and it is worth noting that there is some
 additional stuff that's a little more worrisome um the full list contains a lot more uh there is
 birthday profile photo relationship status current and previous employers with dates places
 previously lived uh and skill sets yeah but again well why will right i don't know why you put those
 in if they're super secret i'm right that's a i'm not sure maybe there was some incentive to do that but
 so so google says it does not include any other data right you may have posted or connected
 to google plus or any other service like google plus posts messages google account data phone
 numbers well except in your case where well i put them in yeah yes i have one public number and
 one private number in there right or or g-suite content then they say we discovered and immediately
 patched this bug in march of 2018 we believe it occurred after launch as i should mention that's
 2015 so it had been present for years as a result of the apis interaction with a subsequent google
 plus code change they said we made google plus with privacy in mind and therefore keep this apis
 log data for only two weeks which in this case turns out to have been a double-edged sword
 they say that means we cannot confirm which users may have been impacted by this bug however we ran
 a detailed analysis over the two weeks prior to patching the bug meaning they had those two weeks
 of previous log data and from that analysis the profiles of up to 500 000 google plus accounts
 were potentially affected thus so then that's a key word our analysis showed that up to 438
 applications may have used this the so-called people api and then they conclude we found no
 evidence that any developer was aware of this bug or abusing the api and we found no evidence
 that any profile data was misused so i i i think they have behaved responsibly unfortunately
 um look what happens when when an uncritical reading of the details gets loose and so
 given that and and and apparently the wall street journal reported that they got a hold of internal
 memoranda which suggested that that google was concerned that uh soon dar would be yanked in front
 of a congressional committee a la facebook and the the abuse of facebook's private information
 and all kind of lumped into one mess at if back in march they had said we found a bug
 that we have no evidence was misused but it could have been and it could have affected
 up to half a million google plus users private data again an uncritical understanding of this
 he even now led to those headlines so i think google did the right thing um i you know it would
 be nice to have had all of the logs of that but then that could have been a problem i mean like
 even a potentially bigger problem so you know i don't think as i said it's a double-edged sword i
 i come down on the side of thing in the google given the situation did the right thing
 we were unable to stop talking about for better or for worse the windows 10 october 2018 update
 the infamous build 1809 uh has another problem uh so as we know the good news is it's still not
 really re-released yet so they found this uh in some preview build 18234 also nine is known as
 19 h1 who i've not been tracking all this cryptic 19 h1 is the next one okay so this is 1809 is the
 one that was supposed to come out now yes September 2018 that now you're talking about 1903 basically
 which is 19 h1 the first half of 2019 so that's uh that's that's in the insiders are getting this now
 okay you know there's something wrong with the process at microsoft this is actually getting
 to be problematic i mean seriously and and we know leo we're looking for that in that new era of
 enhanced productivity you know was that was that what they were advertising in the most secure version
 of windows ever that as we well remember there are a number of articles recently saying the problem
 really is the way microsoft does this which is they've got a code base they do these short like six
 weeks sprints to add a feature so they spent a long time thinking of the features they in six to
 eight weeks they create the feature there's no testing at that point they lay it into a testing
 version which they then test for a long period of time this is how they did it when they did
 three-year releases but they're still doing this now for these biannual releases oh and
 it's not an effective testing process they need a better way of testing before they get them into
 these beta releases that may be there may be a structural problem here we'll talk about tomorrow
 on windows weekly i'm sure so as we know when the content uh those of us who are power windows
 users uh and who understand zip files when the content of a zip file extraction would cause
 the overwrite of an existing same named file within the archive the user i know leo get are you sitting
 down the user should be prompted about the pending overwrite yeah that's right a file naming collision
 and asked whether to replace or skip the extraction of the colliding file it turns out
 that build 1809 uh is reportedly and reproducibly either overwriting existing zip file content without
 notification or silently failing and doing nothing so the good news is this problem has been
 caught before what well what i wrote now i'm not sure i saw it it's been caught before the full
 formal rerelease of build 1809 uh but it was reported as being in 1809 i assumed it was the
 pre-release people yeah um a recent tweet by an it staff engineer at microsoft on the windows insider
 program team indicated that this problem has been resolved back on october 6th with the windows
 insider preview build 18234 which is 19 h1 huh so let me fix it for the next generation
 yeah well they clearly had to fix it now and i know that this is just i'm kicking this dead horse
 one last time but in some recent reporting over on computer world i noted that microsoft's forensic
 analysis revealed that as many as 1500 instances of build 1809's pre-release testers had their files
 deleted and complained oh without microsoft noticing microsoft said it was one percent one one hundredth
 of one percent yeah what you just say what percentage 1500 by number oh okay that might fit that
 might fit because a lot of people try these builds you know this is a they did uh they did and uh but
 a lot got bit and microsoft said oh but we we we missed that one also i should just note that i
 after talking about this for last the last few podcasts uh in between then and now i updated the
 machine i'm talking to you on leo this this this camera that i'm looking at uh is running windows 10
 it was running windows 10 home which is what came pre-installed on the little windows 10 box that i
 just grabbed uh just a little turnkey box anyway it's now running pro all right because i'm an msdn
 subscriber so it doesn't cost me anything to update so i updated the pro since i definitely
 decided that i want to begin hanging back from each month's security updates as well as the biannual
 feature unquote update right uh you know there's nothing i need that much each month it's worth being
 bit like this and you know i'd i'd rather let them you know i think that the security release we would
 know within a week if it was causing problems so you know i've set that to you know give me two weeks
 and i i think i set it to 30 days for the feature uh update because we would know by then if it's
 something if you really should put it off further so uh again and and as i mentioned windows 10 home
 does not give you the option to delay to defer these you take them when they make them available
 i hope that our listeners uh consider after you know this painful if october this set of
 october surprises uh you know considered deferring as i now have enough i mean so much so that i
 switched to to the pro version just so that i you know i could have that feature it seriously
 seems wrong that microsoft is you know making is being stingy about that now we're going to make
 you have pro if you want to you know defer like my god okay oh windows 1809 the gift that just keeps
 on giving i think they they finally did ship 1809 and they followed by solved all the problems
 but of course guess what microsoft's gonna be right back at the table in the spring they're
 currently calling it uh what is it uh 2019 one h i suppose at some point it'll transmogrify
 into a 1903 those are those date-based code names we've talked a lot about that on this show we've
 talked a lot about it on windows weekly and uh just cross your fingers the 2019 doesn't bring
 more windows flaws i hope you've enjoyed security now i think it's probably the most important show
 we do certainly for those of you who are security professionals or just regular users trying to
 keep yourself safe online we really appreciate everything steve does i want to thank karsten
 bondi for putting all of this together he found all the best of uh clips and our editors who edited
 this one is it uh do you know colleen might know anyway thank you to our editors for putting these
 together they work hard so they can take a little time off and be with their families i hope you're
 being hope you're with your family on this holiday season and i'm glad that you consider us part of
 your holiday family thanks for watching all this time 13 years of security malan well here's to 13
 more steve says it's going to continue until episode 9.99 maybe we can work out and get them to go into
 four digits happy holidays everybody happy new year here's to a safe and peaceful 2019 we'll see you
 on january bye bye
