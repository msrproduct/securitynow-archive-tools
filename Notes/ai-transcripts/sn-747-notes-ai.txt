 Well, we come to the end of 2019. What a crazy year for security. This has been
 No, I know I look like Steve Gibson. I'm this is Leo report
 Steve Gibson is here. We're gonna look back at the year 2019 with our best of show right after this
 Security now comes to you from the last past studios in Petaluma, California
 Securing every access point in your company doesn't have to be a challenge last pass unifies access and authentication
 To make securing your employees simple and secure check out last pass dot com slash twit to learn more
 Podcasts you love from people you trust
 This is twit
 This is security now episode 747 for new years eve Tuesday, December 31st 2019 the year's best
 I think you could probably say that the year 2019 was the year ransomware
 Got even bigger. We'll probably say the same thing for the next five years running
 But there was a lot to talk about in 2019 including
 And this may have happened to you Steve Gibson explains why your printer keeps printing out advertisements for Pewdiepie
 I believe it or not leo
 on this first cast
 Of the new year. We're going to talk about yes
 Pewdiepie oh Pewdiepie
 this time
 Chromecast users
 have had
 Pewdiepie
 pushing
 Video content interrupting their viewing whoa
 If you can believe it or not get a look yes on reddit someone posted tv randomly switching to some pewdiepie video
 He posted every 20 minutes or so my tv switches to some crappy youtube video about pewdiepie
 with eddy said
 rap music and a pound chromecast hack hashtag
 All anyone know how to stop this it's driving me bonkers
 Now google's response to this from the from grace from google the google community manager
 grace wrote hi everybody
 We know how frightening this is
 The good news is your chromecast hasn't actually been hacked in quotes
 Rather somebody was able to cast to your chromecast
 Due to an opening in your home network. Oh, yeah, that's a great comfort
 This is the result of your router making some smart devices including chromecast
 publicly reachable
 No, actually it's a consequence of chromecast telling your router that has universal plug and play enabled
 That it would like some ports mapped to it pretty please
 Okay, so it is both, you know, it is universal plug and play how many times what must we say, you know the
 I will say that the instant it appeared on this podcast. We said turn it off
 This is really bad
 Turn it off
 And we know that xbox people were that was a hardship for them because you know arguably
 This was created so that xbox would be able to have ports mapped into it
 So anyway, what we have is the return of hacker giraffe remember that
 Twice now
 Leo once while you were gone
 Then the second time that for you the first mention on this podcast of pewdiepie
 Was his second hack of a greater number of printers which are exposed on the internet all
 Sending out the what what there was like the number two youtuber was some
 Yeah, it's a it's a
 Alien Indian channel T power or something. Yeah, it's just starting to beat pewdiepie and
 Right, right, right. Okay. So by the way pew. I think pewdiepie his t-series has
 Yep, that's it's bleed to pewdiepie. That's what it was. It was t-series. So anyway on the fact for
 The hacker giraffe.com
 They asked themselves what's going on if you came here because you're a victim of cast hack
 Then know that your chrome cast slash smart tv slash google home
 Is exposed to the public internet and is leaking sensitive information
 related to your device and home
 What information is leaked
 What wifi your chrome cast slash google home is connected to
 The bluetooth devices it has paired to how long it's been on what wifi networks your device remembers
 What alarms you have set and much more
 What can hackers do with this remotely play media on your device rename your device?
 Factory reset or reboot the device
 Force it to forget all wifi networks force it to pair to a new bluetooth speaker
 Or wifi point and so on
 What can't hackers do?
 He says assuming that the chrome cast google home is the only problem you have
 Hackers cannot access other devices on the network
 Or sniff information besides wifi points and bluetooth devices
 They also don't have access to your personal google account nor the google home's microphone
 They do have access to the noise level in the room. However, which is interesting
 Then the the faq that they wrote for themselves asks themselves. Who are you?
 Your friendly neighborhood hacker giraffe
 We just want to have a bit of fun while
 While educating and protecting people. Of course, this is breaking the law, but what the heck
 And protecting people from open devices on the net on the internet. We were also behind the printer hack and printer hack too
 Why are you doing this? We want to help you and also our favorite youtubers
 Mostly pewdiepie
 We're only trying to protect you and inform you of this before someone takes real advantage of it
 Imagine the consequences of having access to the information above
 What do you want?
 Well, fix your device and also subscribe to pewdiepie
 on youtube also
 pyrocynical dolan dark and
 and
 grande
 GRA. I'm not gonna. This is why you're never gonna never gonna succeed on youtube
 Gotta be able to read these
 Wow
 Don't forget good old keemstar
 Okay
 How do I fix my device?
 He says disable up&p on your router and if you're port forwarding forwarding if you're if you're port forwarding ports
 8,000 and eight
 eight four four three
 eight double nine
 Then stop forwarding them. Well your chromecast stop working if you do that
 No, okay, uh, thank you. Any way to show support. Yes. I he says I hacker giraffe have other things to do
 Use my free time. You please go
 Yes
 Use my free time teaching people cyber security and ethical hacking. Okay
 Uh, if you want to support personally
 Or enjoyed this hack. Oh, yeah, it was enjoyable
 Consider becoming a patron on my patron page and I by the way, I went and it had been canceled or closed
 So I don't think that
 worked
 so, uh
 Okay, so if you go to the page that is listed in this in the
 Show notes cast hack dot the hacker giraffe.com
 you get a
 a
 status page
 total exposed devices
 72,000
 341
 Of those
 8,254 were renamed
 And 65,283 that is the balance
 Have been forced to play video
 So more than 65,000
 Chromecast or smart tv devices
 received this this annoying youtube video
 Um, that uh that same number of 72, 341
 Breaks down as 1542 were google home devices
 And the remaining 67,049 were smart tv's or chromecast devices
 so
 Anyway, google
 Did google did say
 That this was the fault of youth p&p
 being enabled
 That this grace from google continued after blaming it on up&p and I don't
 Because this is as chromecast saying open ports to me, please
 She she wrote to make your network more secure
 You can disable up&p to avoid any unwanted content being played on your devices
 How convenient
 The instructions are different from router to router
 So we suggest checking with the manufacturer of your particular device, however
 This may affect other apps and devices that use up&p to function
 Meaning chromecast doesn't really need it, but we thought what the heck let's open supports because why not?
 so um
 What I would note the there's been coverage of this
 um
 It's
 as we have mentioned before
 the port mapping done by the up&p api
 Typically is hidden from the user so as not to confuse them like wait a minute. I didn't map these ports
 So they don't appear in the ui
 What I would recommend if first of all remember that grc the first time this it became apparent to me
 on the podcast leo that universal plug and play
 was
 being
 enabled externally
 It was like okay. Wait a minute. Let's check for that. So although this doesn't require an external
 Presence, but you know our shields up service has still has from that from that day on a quick chest
 Test for external access
 That's what the bad guys are using for for proxying traffic and setting up bots and so forth
 And now turning around and using it to look inside people's networks
 So you absolutely want that disabled form external access, but this is
 Internal use and it is the case that as grace notes
 um
 That
 That there may be some things you are doing on your network that
 Will stop working if you disable it
 typically however
 It is possible to manually configure the ports to the devices that need it
 The problem with having universal plug and play enabled is there's and this is what the first point
 We made about it when it first hit our radar was it is there's no authentication
 There's no username no password
 Nothing it is wide open so that anything
 Inside your network has access to it if it's enabled and can can do anything it wants to with your route
 behind your back
 I mean it just it's
 Unconsciously bad it always was and and we keep seeing instances where it's biting people
 um, and you know, so
 Uh, the point is that if you disable it, you should did you should reboot your router
 The universal plug and play mappings are typically dynamically made they are not statically
 stored in non-volatile memory so a reboot should flush them but turning it off won't necessarily
 Close these holes because it'll prevent new ones from being mapped
 But probably leave the existing ones in place
 And if you're going through all that take the time to check with the that the router's web manufacturer's website
 With the version number remember that we've seen already an instance where the router itself
 Wasn't aware that there was a newer version so even a router that if that that is is trying to check to see whether
 It should update itself may not have the latest information about what is available for its own
 Uh firmware so check the manufacturer
 Um always update to the latest
 Uh shut down universal playing play universal plug and play if you believe you can and then do a reboot in any event
 So that if you're trying to close things down you have a chance of doing so
 And don't forget to subscribe to pyrocynical dole and dark and grande
 That's right get props to pewdiepie and cool. I'm star
 So, uh also
 Uh
 Ooh, sorry i threw you i apologize
 I said one last by the way pewdiepie is beating
 But it's t-series, but it's really close as of seconds ago
 Wow, yeah pewdiepie has uh, um
 About 400,000 more subscribers. He's got 80 million subscribers by the way. It's it's amazing the number
 Although probably those aren't real people or maybe they are. I don't know how it works
 Yeah, he's got he if you if you really care he's got 80,000 224
 80 million 224,368 subscribers to t-series t-series 79 million
 486,000 103 subscribers
 I know you're glad now now. I was just doing that to give you time to find your place. Go ahead. And I did thank you
 You're welcome
 Uh, what's annoying is that google knows about this
 They have known about this for years
 Uh, there are a number of youtube hacks
 From dating from 2014 showing chrome cast being commandeered like, well
 Play something on your neighbor's chrome cast
 You have to be in physical proximity or can you do it anywhere in the world?
 Any well, not
 At least this way here you can do it anywhere in the world because it's publicly open and that's what this guy did
 This hacker giraffe to how many was it is 72,341
 Video devices were played of or found of those more than 65,000
 Had been forced to play video
 Do you show Dan to find that how would you find that?
 Um
 Showdamp may very well because that we know that that's the tool he used to find the
 Printer exploits before so he may have just said, oh, what else can I do to push PewDiePie?
 Because after all it's neck and neck with with t-shirt
 That's actually t-series. I don't see series
 To our listeners who are or maybe you know, uh, well, yeah, are we know we have listeners of all ages
 We have people who say hey, how do I get started in security?
 I want to you know, I want to consider a career. What do I do?
 Or maybe you've got some free time. Maybe you're living with your folks. So you're in high school and
 Uh, and you're what i'm thinking it'd be fun to see if you could uh earn some extra cash on the side
 It is truly possible to have a career
 If you're good in bug as a bug
 As a bug hunter and getting bug bounties
 Uh, i've got in the in that uh, it was just a it was a picture that was uh covered in hacker ones posting
 We have a picture of 19 year old sontiago lopez
 Who has just crossed the one million dollar mark
 from
 Purely one million us dollars. He is the first
 bug bounty hunter
 millionaire
 Just from finding and reporting security vulnerabilities through hacker ones bug bounty program
 I I noted at the top of the show that we don't know
 If maybe he's made actually more money than that because he's sold some really tasty ones to his imperium who knows
 Um, he's got an interesting twitter feed. I would commend people to go poke at i've got a link in the show notes also
 uh
 And last friday march first the bbc ran an interview with sia
 sontiago titled how one teenager is making millions by hacking legally
 Uh, their byline said this or their their little summary said this 19 year old sontiago lopez from argin
 Uh, this is sorry 19 year old sontiago lopez from argin tinnia
 Argin i have a problem pronouncing that argin
 Tina argin tina g yeah one more syllable and then it's supposed to argin tina. Thank you leo
 He's the first million he's the first millionaire bug bounty hacker, which means he gets paid
 This is the bbc's talking. Of course. We all know they are gets paid to find glitches
 In the software of some of the world's biggest companies mr
 Lopez made his money on the world's biggest ethical hacking platform hacker one
 Bbc news joe tidy has been has been to see how he spends the money
 Thus the bbc story that I think our listers may find interesting and I have a a link as I said to that in the show notes
 and also
 hacker one did a report
 Uh published on february 1st so a little over a month ago. They said
 Today the hacker one community hit 45 million dollars in bounty payouts
 Join us as we celebrate the hackers who are making the internet a safer place
 Every single day
 The party is going to last the whole way to a history making
 50 million
 in bounty payouts
 And in there in this posting that I have or their pdf that I have a link to
 They started off by by defining hacker
 So they show you know hacker and how it's pronounced phonetically declaring it to be a noun
 And for their definition, which I really like they said
 One who enjoys the intellectual challenge of creatively overcoming limitations
 And I think that's a great definition of a hacker
 One who enjoys the intellectual challenge of creatively overcoming limitations
 And again, I would commend this report to our listeners who might be interested
 They had they have a lot of of of like bios and
 And details about the hackers. I'll say I'll share just the top of it. They said
 Welcome to the age of the hacker hackers are heroes
 They're in it for the good and there is more opportunity than ever before
 We share some of their stories and celebrate their impact in this the third annual hacker report
 The hacker report details the more than
 300,000 individuals that represent our hacker community today
 It highlights where hackers live what motivates them and what their favorite hacking targets and tools are
 Where they learn why they collaborate and much more
 in 2018 alone
 Hackers earned more than 19 million dollars in bounties
 Almost the entire amount awarded in the years prior
 combined
 So it's on a ramp
 And while the most successful find it very lucrative
 It's about so much more than money
 Many are finding career building opportunities through bug bounties, which companies hiring
 from with
 Bug bounties with companies hiring from within the hacker community
 At a faster clip than ever before and that's a point i've made
 um like there are some very
 beautiful
 Pieces of work where i've thought to myself boy, you know if i were in the hiring business still i
 Ask this person for a job. They are good
 They say companies are utilizing bug bounty reports and hacker engagement
 as an enhanced resume of proven skills that will impact company goals and security efforts from day one
 The generosity and camaraderie of hackers continues to impress
 With more effort emphasis than ever before on education collaboration and giving back
 As hacking grows in popularity training continues to be a focus with more than 600 hackers joining
 Registering to join the ranks at any given day
 In-depth training modules such as hacker one capture capture the flag challenges are in demand
 They say the past year
 We saw incredible individual performances such as hackers earning
 $1,000 for one vulnerability and the first hacker
 Santiago passing the one million milestone
 One million dollar milestone. We also saw unmatched collaboration while hackers acting as teams to report over
 250 valid customer vulnerabilities
 They say hackers represent a global force for good
 Coming together to help address the growing security needs of our increasingly interconnected society
 The community welcomes all who enjoy the intellectual challenge to creatively overcome limitations
 Their reasons for hacking may vary
 But the results are consistently impressing the growing ranks of organizations
 Embracing hackers through hacker powered security
 I like that hacker powered security leaving us all a lot safer than before
 And they did note that top earners top hacker earners can make up to 40 times
 The median annual wage of a software engineer in their home country
 respectively
 so
 I
 I think what we're seeing is we're seeing a c change here
 hacker powered security
 And you know if you've got skills
 with a z
 I think you ought to consider it. Where does one get its money from?
 Deprived there and it did there hired them
 Yes, so so bounties are posted by like ge and
 And tesla and others to say we are
 Formally inviting people to try to find problems in our products and if found we will pay
 But why go through hacker one why not just go directly to ge does hacker one keep a cut
 There no, well, they they do keep a small cut, but they're a clearing house
 And they so so they've got the hackers registered with them and they're able to then post
 Opportunities of of like you know, here are things that ge
 Would be interested in having you attempt to find vulnerabilities in
 And and here are the payouts for from ge on various classes of vulnerabilities that you find
 And they get so five percent of something for that service exactly exactly and so so so they're like the
 The clearing house and they put the hackers together with those
 Offering bounties to have their basically hacker powered security have their security tested and improved
 I just think it's it's a win. It's really a business idea actually on that part
 Yes, totally see that for the the right kind of guy
 Who's you know eclectic and doesn't want to work for the man
 And and you know has faith and confidence in their own skills
 It's something you could start part-time while you're you know in high school or going through college
 See if you've got what it takes
 And just like this podcast that is not running out of material lord knows
 We're at the two hour and nine-minute mark at this point
 So
 It is very clear the world is not going to run out of bugs ever
 One of the big stories of
 2018 was the mariah botnet
 Uh, in fact, as I remember mariah took over routers and took down the playstation network and other servers
 During the holiday season last year
 Well mariah didn't go away in 2019 in fact according to steve
 It was bigger than ever
 The mariah botnet is
 Alive and well and more scary and capable than ever
 um
 Will remember that the that is considered an iot malware
 It broke the d-dos attack size record
 In 2016 when it was used to attack brian Krebs forcing him
 like off the net also the french web host. Oh, uh, oh vh
 Was attacked and then all and then most famously the dns provider dine dns
 Was forced off the net and of course
 Because that that d we all depend upon dns
 To varying degrees that caused a ripple effect and all kinds of other sites
 Disappeared as their dns expired and it couldn't get refreshed from the from the from their assigned dns provider if it was in this case dine dns
 so
 mariah
 Has been updated to target a new crop of devices including two
 Which are often found inside enterprise networks
 Where as we know bandwidth is often more plentiful than it is on consumer iot
 networks mirror i now knows how to infect webcams routers
 dvrs
 as well as many other internet content devices which typically ship with default credentials as we know and
 typically
 They're running never updated and thus woefully outdated versions of linux
 yesterday morning
 Palo Alto networks unit 42. I love it that they call their sums themselves the unit 42 or they posted
 News of a new mirror i titled new mirror i variant targets enterprise wireless presentation and display systems
 So i've edited this down a bit for length and clarity
 But they basically wrote the mirror i variant that unit 42 discovered is notable for targeting different embedded devices
 like routers network storage devices
 network video recorders and ip cameras
 Using numerous exploits against them specifically unit 42 found this new variant targeting
 We present wipg 1000 wireless presentation systems and
 lg's super sign tv's they wrote both these devices are intended for use by businesses
 This development indicates to us a potential shift to using mirror i to target enterprises
 attack code
 Exploiting a we present command injection vulnerability was published in 2017
 While a remote code and execution exploit for the lg super sign tv's has been available since last september
 After being packaged into this new mirror i variant the exploits become much more likely than previously
 To actively be used to compromise their vulnerable devices
 And this is not the first time mirror i has been aimed at enterprise networks last september palo alto networks reported that mirror i was found targeting the same
 Apache struts vulnerability that hackers exploited to breach equifax
 So in addition to this newer targeting this new mirror i variant incorporates 11 new exploits
 In its multi exploit kit the new and has four sets of new credentials used in brute forcing device sign on
 So mirror i is still alive and well
 It had 16 previous
 Previously seen
 Exploits it added 11 so it's gotten way more competent and it is still out there scanning the internet
 Looking for new victims and unfortunately finding them
 It uses a
 An HTTP flood to do
 DDoS attacks and
 And and it is a worm so once it gets
 A beachhead it then starts scanning for other available devices both inside and outside of its network
 So you know doesn't look at the internet is going to be getting rid of mirror i anytime soon
 And we're just going to you know be stuck with this thing and it's going to be
 You know causing more havoc
 Teams from the gras university of technology whom we have spoken of before
 k u luven
 And cybers technology have been added again
 Uh, and if we ever wanted as i mentioned at the top of the show, I'm a perfect example of bruche nier's sage observation that attacks never get weaker
 They only ever get stronger. Oh, we have it here
 What these guys have done quietly although they've known for a year none of us have
 um
 They have been sitting probably impatiently on this
 um
 Is a truly significant advancement
 to
 um
 the practicality
 of
 What was the mostly theoretical attack on speculation and micro architectural
 performance boosting
 That we began talking about right from the start of last year
 so
 The the term micro architecture is all throughout this
 um, so let me just explain the architecture is what
 The code that runs on the processor
 sees so it's you know, it's the registers, uh, it's the
 Uh, the stack
 the
 Various execution units, you know, the the it's it's the view
 That the that the processor provides to the code
 It was quite a while ago that that stopped being the only architecture in the chip
 um
 especially for the intel
 Chips because the instructions are so complicated that as they as they became as they kept adding new features
 they
 The the the idea of designing this instruction set implementing the instruction set
 As gates just as simple logic became
 impossible, especially when they started wanting to get really fancy
 so
 What happened was they created a processor inside the processor. They're you know, the the so-called micro code
 So that runs the micro code runs on the micro architecture
 Which is this this?
 This processor running at the clock speed
 That is given to the chip. They've you know, three gigahertz or whatever it is and and that processor
 Essentially implements the instruction set that the outside world sees
 so
 And that's how
 When micro when when intel produces a an update to the firmware of the chip that that's the micro code
 That implements this and so so that's what so that
 So for example when they talk about micro architectural data sampling vulnerabilities
 what what the what the lid that's been torn off of
 of the intel architecture unfortunately is
 that
 that there are all kinds of
 Because you have a processor in a processor because there's there's a whole another dance going on
 separate from the one that's public
 All of the attention up until now has been on the security of the public
 Processor that is it's been scrutinized and it's been looked at and it's been validated as
 secure nothing leaks at that level, but
 What what we what as soon as we started looking past that
 We got the specter and meltdown problems at the beginning of last year. So
 so
 This is just you know, this is so tasty for researchers
 no one who's really into this has been able to put it down and
 What what has what came to light?
 Last Tuesday morning as this podcast was already
 set up and ready to go
 was
 Essentially, I would say it's more than the next shoe to drop. It's it's an anvil dropped because
 what was
 What happened was the the change from
 theoretical to?
 Absolutely proven
 This is probably why intel was really in a panic that intel is known of this for a year
 and
 So the good news is you know, they've taken responsibility. I would oh my god
 I would do anything to be a fly on the wall of I mean like to know
 Really what has been going on inside their meetings because
 I mean it has to be
 some some you know
 Serious discussion about you know how they got into this position and how these problems occurred, but anyway
 um
 What we have now
 after more than a year of trouble
 Is the so-called it's sort of been generalized
 to micro architectural data sampling vulnerabilities
 and to
 That original work which first brought us meltdown
 we have on this site CPU dot fail
 Has
 Zombie load that we had fun just saying
 Last week we have something called ridl
 Fallout and store to leak
 forwarding
 each of those
 Is a different exploitation of subtle features of intel processors
 Which have been produced over the last eight years since around 2011
 Which makes which as a consequence
 Make it extremely difficult for it the processor
 To keep its secrets
 As it was always designed to that is I mean until the beginning of last year
 We had these processors sitting on servers
 in cloud environments
 with vms sharing a single core among
 any random set of
 of
 parties whether
 whether
 Friendly to each other or not
 um
 That all changed at the beginning of last year because it turns out that it is
 It was at that time it was theoretically possible
 A couple examples were shown mostly. It was done like oh, you know goodness
 Here's a problem. We need need to fix this before it's too late
 Well, what we got just last Tuesday
 in the form of
 firmware updates for the micro architectures
 At some significant
 Performance hit i've seen some benchmarks that look like it takes maybe 10
 to 12 percent off the top which is a chunk of performance
 Because unfortunately as we've seen in order to prove you know, these these problems are
 are a result of
 of the past
 Of other threads of execution leaving trails leaving hints
 In the micro architecture which clever researchers are able to pull or able to tease out
 Over time and and again these attacks have only gotten better
 A co okay, so zombie load i'm not going to go into infinite detail
 But I want because I just want to give our listeners a sense for this zombie load
 uh
 resurrects
 private browsing history and other sensitive data
 It allows the leakage of information from other applications from the operating system
 Across virtual machine boundaries in the cloud and from trusted execution environments
 The ridl attack allows the leakage of information across various security domains
 From different buffers such as lined fill buffers and load ports
 Those are micro architecture attributes that are not surfaced at the processor level
 But they're they're all part of the plumbing that's going on behind the scenes
 Our idl demonstrates attacks on other applications
 The operating system virtual machines and trusted execution environments
 So there's a lot of overlap between these but they are different there are different types of attacks against
 against different facets of the micro architecture the fallout attack
 allows reading
 uh what the operating system recently wrote
 and figuring out the memory position
 Of components of the operating system
 Thus strengthening other attacks in other words. It helps to defeat
 K a slr kernel address space layout randomization
 And finally the store to leak forwarding
 exploits cpu optimizations
 introduced by
 Another i our micro architectural component the store buffer
 To break to also break address randomization
 Monitor the operating system or to leak data when combined with some aspects of specter
 Specter created these these gadgets which were were
 Way a little pieces of code which were used
 Store to leak forwarding is able to reuse some of these specter gadgets essentially making the attacks
 stronger
 Microsoft for their part last tuesday on may 14th
 wrote
 uh on may 14th intel published information
 About a new subclass of speculative
 execution side channel vulnerabilities known as
 micro architectural
 Data sampling and of course now we know the data being sampled
 Is somebody else's data if you happen to be sharing
 It an intel processor with somebody else
 Microsoft said an attacker who successfully exploited these vulnerabilities
 May be able to read privileged data across trust boundaries
 In shared resource environments such as exists in some cloud services
 Configurations these vulnerabilities could allow
 One virtual machine to improperly access information from another
 So this is you know sounds like a repeat of what we've been talking about all of last year
 In non browsing scenarios on standalone systems
 An attacker would need prior access to the system or an art or an ability to run
 Especially crafted application on the target system to leverage these vulnerabilities
 What they didn't explicitly say is that code running in a browser
 Is able to determine what the browser has been doing
 So it's a potentially significant
 um privacy violation
 Just using a browser at the browser level
 So they allocated or I should say the the cve system allocated for different cve's
 um
 Micro architecture store buffer data sampling which was given the acronym ms bds
 micro architecture fill
 buffer data sampling mf bds
 micro architecture load port data sampling
 mlpds and micro architectural data data sampling of uncasurable memory
 mdsum
 so
 Over on the cpu.fail site
 They did a little q&a to sort of help demystify this
 They asked am I affected by this bug the answer most certainly yes
 Are these software bugs? No
 These bugs are in the processor software can work around these bugs which costs performance
 Future processors will have integrated fixes and that is no doubt true
 They ask can I detect whether someone has exploited this leakage against me
 They say we have no data on this the exploitation
 Might may not leave any traces in traditional log files
 Can my av detect or block these attacks?
 They said while possible in theory. This is unlikely in practice
 These attacks are hard to distinguish from regular benign applications
 However, they write your av may detect malware which uses the attacks by comparing binaries after they become known
 They ask has this been used in the wild and they answer we don't know
 So that they wrote a 16 page detailed paper that i'm not going to drag us through
 and i've already pretty much explained what i had here in the
 That i quoted from the abstract at the top of the paper
 They conclude though saying with zombie load
 We showed and then this is in the in these 16 pages in zombie load
 We showed a novel meltdown type attack
 Targeting the processors fill buffer logic zombie load enables an attacker to leak recently loaded values
 Used by the current or sibling logical CPU
 We show that zombie load allows leaking across user space processes
 CPU protection rings virtual machines and sgx enclaves
 We demonstrated and they did this
 The immense attack potential and that's what has changed if i mean the takeaway here is this went from being well
 Okay, you know, yeah in theory, this could happen this
 This research changed this to
 Making these practical attacks. They said we demonstrate the immense attack potential by monitoring browser behavior
 extracting aes encryption keys
 establishing cross vm
 covert channels
 And recovering sgx ceiling keys in intel's secure enclave
 Finally, we conclude with that we conclude that
 disabling hyper threading
 Is the only possible workaround to mitigate zombie load on current processors
 so
 For what it means to us as i said
 This is this is primarily a further collapse in
 inter thread isolation
 Inter thread isolation only matters if you've got if you have one way or another
 A system has a malicious thread running on it
 um in the case of a user's machine
 Um a malicious thread we would call malware in that case. You've already got malware on your system and so you're in trouble
 Um, you know that this this could be a way
 Of a for malware to extract encryption keys from your system like for example
 If you were using bit locker and depending upon bit lockers
 Encryption of your hard drive
 It would be possible for malware to reach into the kernel to get the key that it would not otherwise have access to because it would be well protected
 Um, and then you know
 Make off with it or send it somewhere use it do whatever whatever it wants to
 So
 But in general once you've already got a malicious thread on your system
 You've you're already in trouble
 The real problem as i've mentioned is in the cloud environment where you might very well have a
 a huge
 heterogeneous environment with a a data center full of servers that are that are just
 Mixing and matching and running anybody's code on any piece of hardware, you know moving vms about
 Without any concern. That's the way a lot of these systems are set up now
 The problem is a bad guy gets in there on a system that has not been mitigated against this set of problems and you've got trouble
 Um, I know under
 Linux with these patches applied and a state-of-the-art Linux
 I've seen some benchmarks that look like it takes about as I said about 10 to 12 percent of performance right off the top
 Um, it looks like it's a it's a larger hit on the later processors because the later processors
 More thoroughly take advantage of of sophisticated micro architecture in order in order to speed things up
 So as I said, my subtitle was speeding up is hard to do basically. I mean, I don't know what intel is going to do
 um, there probably what it means is
 That we're going to have to build into our operating system
 Some some explicit flushing or or maybe an an additional level of blinding
 Between threads
 Right now there is very little thread isolation between hyper threads because hyper threading is basically a second set of registers
 That you just you do a very fast context switch from one bank of registers to the next
 Uh, it was a clever very inexpensive
 Way of of allowing a processor to continue running when it would otherwise have had its thread stall waiting for something
 Intel said hey wait a minute, you know, we'll almost no additional logic
 We can create a lightweight a lightweight context switch
 Just by you know creating a second logical thread on the same hardware. Yes, they were right
 But boy, you know, you don't want to have that other thread sharing the same core, which is what happens
 You don't want to have it be malicious. So
 So already we had this notion at the
 Architecture level of context switching. That's you know, that's what we do is you know when when we push all of the threads on the stack
 and then load
 load the uh, all the registers from a different
 Thread that has been been stopped. That's a context switch
 What I think we're going to end up seeing is intel having to in order to save
 You know the the fundamental design of their chips and and implement a system, which is secure
 We're going to have to get something liked like a context switching mechanism at the micro architecture level
 um
 It should have always had it. Nobody was looking and and nobody was this clever
 About and I guess really appreciated how much information could be obtained from little
 Subtle variations and timing at this point
 Uh, it really breaks the barrier between certainly between hyper threaded
 A pair of threads running on the same core and of course as we know now since cores share caches and we're able to probe cash contents
 Um, nothing is safe. So
 Uh, uh, at a cost of performance today. We're getting for we're getting firmware updates
 Um
 Microsoft has said they're only going to be doing it for windows 10. So, um, if you are running windows 7
 In an environment where you're at risk and again, there's a bunch of caveats in an environment where you're at risk
 Then it's worth updating your bios. I mean, I guess in general
 It's there's no reason not to update your bios is one of the is available from your manufacturer
 But unless you are in an environment where you really are running
 Um, threads that have a high have a probability a likelihood of a reasonable possibility of being malicious
 If that's not your environment, all of this is
 Interesting and it's being fixed for you, but probably not a source of it should not be a source of great concern
 Good
 Yes, and I wonder with it when they fix it with hardware mitigations if they can do it without penalty
 I think we're going to get performance back. Yes, because I mean this really did catch them off guard and
 I mean, I'm as I've said before I'm amazed they can fix this with firmware changes
 I mean that suggests that the chips are way more programmable than I would have imagined
 And so the fact that they can actually add
 You know like what amounts to major features basically there are there are feature registers
 That only the kernel has access to sometimes you only have a lot like access at the bios level at boot time
 And then it's all locked down
 Um, but they're adding bits that were never assigned to feature registers
 Which are controlling?
 Significant aspects of the micro architecture. I'm amazed that they can do that in microcode
 I mean, it's like the whole thing really is deeply programmable, which surprises me
 Well, so I mean all they're doing is saying don't do speculative execution in effect, right?
 Yeah, but they never had a reason not to
 Why exactly exactly well, I mean what it tells you is that a lot of the way processors work is not in the processor
 It's in the microcode, which is programmable, right? So, I mean, I'm being this is a very stupid way of looking at it
 But maybe they just did a branch around the speculative part like there's a chunk of code that that says well
 Let's see if we can figure out ahead of time what he's gonna do just jump over that stuff keep on going
 Don't try don't attempt it and the reason I ask if hardware fixes can still give you
 the you know the performance is
 I imagine they're just going to eliminate speculative execution in the hardware, which would give you a hint
 Unless they come up with something other than that
 Well, all they have okay knowing what they know now
 They could segment
 Right the history we've talked about this before because the problem is a leak of information from one thread to another
 If you don't make that possible
 You hide it then you don't have to worry about yes
 If the context switching goes deeper into the architecture than just at the architecture level
 If the context switching is pushed into the micro architecture then at a cost of significantly more complexity
 You get performance and you get
 Interthread isolation and that's what we need
 Marcus Hutchins is free
 Free at last
 It was two years ago
 This this coming Defcon
 Uh after the annual 2017 Defcon security conference as Marcus was I guess he was
 He described himself as still sort of suffering. He was hung over and intoxicated
 From partying the night before he was walking through the Las Vegas airport. That's when they get you
 Yeah
 Yeah, have your guard down. Yep, uh preparing to return home to the UK that he was nabbed by
 uh law enforcement
 Uh and of course he had been for many years a reformed
 Gray or black hat, I guess
 Um, I don't think he ever actively participated in
 in malicious hacking, but he did
 write some
 You know in his in his youth
 Uh as as an adolescent he wrote some malware
 um
 Anyway, he was nabbed
 Uh and held on charges of computer hacking fraud and abuse
 Uh, it wasn't long before he was released on bale from jail
 But he was he had I think he had an anc a an ankle
 Uh tracker, so he was working with attorneys and we've talked about him several times over the last couple years
 As his case has moved through the legal system
 um
 And he's been working with a defense team and appearing at various legal hearings from time to time
 Um
 We know that he had outgrown
 That those earlier
 Uh, you know, he's sort of sketchy adolescents
 Uh where he was doing some things that were you know
 Not on the up and up
 And let us not forget
 That what initially brought steve jobs and steve wasniac together
 Was their interest in what what was known as blue boxing
 Which were these
 Little boxes which generated different sets of tones than the normal touch tone tones
 Which were used to sidestep the long distance
 Uh telephone billing that the united that the us telephone system used for making free long-distance phone calls
 So, you know, even our
 Contemporary tech heroes, uh, were you know, not always on the up and up
 Anyway shortly before
 his arrest
 He was studying that as marcus was studying the alarming emergence and rapid propagation
 of the
 Incredibly prolific and dangerous wanna cry internet worm
 And in his research
 He serendipitously halted its progress
 Uh, and we've talked about this many times by
 By looking inside the code
 Seeing that there was it's a kind of an odd
 DNS query that the worm was making
 He went when he looked up what the that that what the dns domain was that it was querying
 He found it was unregistered. He thought okay. That's weird. I wonder what this what it's doing with that dns address
 So he registered it and in the process of it no longer being unregistered
 Just that act
 Halted the worms propagation it and we never really understood in detail like we never had a
 A clear understanding of why it's believed that it that was a kill switch
 Which marcus as I said serendipitously
 Set in order to cause the worm to stop propagating
 and
 It turns out that this was taken into account us district judge
 Joseph peter
 Uh, stat muleur said that the malware hutchins helped stop
 Was much more damaging than the two programs he created
 And thus sends him only to time served with a year of supervised release
 So marcus is free to return to the uk
 Um, he tweeted on july 26th, which was uh last friday
 He tweeted first heading into court now
 No matter what happens. I love y'all
 And then a short time later he tweeted sentenced to time served exclamation port
 Point incredibly thankful for the understanding and leniency of the judge
 The wonderful character letter you all sent and everyone who helped me through the past two years
 Both financially and emotionally that was at 11 25 a.m. Last friday
 So, uh, he's free to return to the uk
 us authorities still need to decide
 Whether he's but now barred from returning to the us due to his criminal record unquote and of course
 In my opinion barring him would be really dumb
 But on the other hand we did say us authorities so
 You know, we'll see what happens
 So that's good news a nice outcome and it would be nice if he were free to return
 You know, he his presentation at at at black hat
 Uh, or defcon was about what he had just done with ruanacry and so
 After you know demonstrating. Hey, he would I mean he had been doing other
 You know white hat hacking things. He was you know
 Uh, uh, his his as we know his twitter handle would was malware tech blog
 Uh, and so you know he was he was blogging about you know
 How to stop this stuff now and uh, anyway, so the you know, this was the right outcome
 And uh, it would be nice if we let him come back to to future black hat and defcon presentations
 So of course, the biggest story of uh 2019 and 2018 and probably 2020
 Is ransomewhere and the summer brought some massive ransomewhere attacks
 It got to the point where I had to say to steve. Okay
 enough
 We know ransomewhere is a problem. This was probably the straw that broke the camels back the massive texas
 ransomware attack 23 cities listens
 the news as of friday
 From texas was government agencies. Nobody knew what government agencies, but we knew there were 23 of them
 Were all hit
 With a will now we know it cities we'll get to that in a minute
 a were all
 simultaneously hit with a well coordinated
 simultaneous
 and effective
 ransomewhere attack last friday august 16th
 23 texas entities the majority of which are local governments
 Were hit by a ransomewhere attack on friday that texas officials say is part of a targeted attack
 launched by a single threat actor
 Details still remain scant about the specific agencies hit by the ransomewhere attacks
 Which began on the morning of august 16th as well as exactly which systems were impacted
 However, the texas department of information resources d i r
 as of saturday night
 Did say that responders are actively working with all
 23 entities and who knows how many were attacked that didn't get infected but 23
 different things different
 networks different agencies now. We know it's actually 23 cities
 Uh, we're brought down by a massive coordinated attack
 um, so
 This d i r the department of information resources is currently working as of saturday night
 To bring their systems back online
 Uh, and that the state of texas systems and networks itself were not
 Impacted so what we do know is that these 23 agencies were knocked offline
 And presumably encrypted by this simultaneous attack i checked
 yesterday
 in local reporting and like of like i don't know the texas gazette or something and
 It didn't have any more information still
 The texas department of information resources website
 Posted a statement saying that quote currently d i r the texas military department
 And texas a and m university system cyber response and security operation center teams
 Are deploying resources to the most critically impacted jurisdictions
 Further resources will be deployed as they are requested
 When pressed for additional details, the texas d i r declined to elucidate any further
 Stating quote due to security concerns
 Unquote, I I or
 Read embarrassment perhaps
 Saying only that they were smaller local governments. Yes 23 of them
 The d i r did not provide information about which systems are down
 How systems were first infected and the specific amount of ransom
 You know that's going to be adding up
 In their reporting of this threat post reached out to representatives from dallas houston and austin for comment
 On whether they were impacted by the attack
 While representatives from dallas and austin have not yet responded
 One of their emails down a spoke person from houston told threat post that as far as we know
 Houston has not been affected
 I think they would know if they had been according to a statement sent to threat post quote
 The city of houston is aware that a ransom wear attack has affected several local government agencies throughout texas
 We are in contact with the texas state operations center and will monitor the latest developments
 Whoo the mayor's office of homeland security and the it services department will continue to proactively work to secure and protect the city's assets
 However, the d i r said that at this time
 And not surprisingly given what we know evidence gathering
 Indicates the attacks came from one single threat actor
 Alan liska
 Who is a threat intel analyst with recorded future we've mentioned we've spoken of them a number of times they're a
 You know in the middle of the thick of things
 Security firm told threat post that the attacks signify an important shift
 In the ransom wear threat model
 Typically state and local governments have been targets of opportunity for ransomware attacks
 With the gangs behind these attacks reuke and sam sam
 Appearing to stumble on to previous
 State and local government targets. However, or that is you know stumble previously onto them
 However, this instance this incident he says appears to be the first
 Where a string of governments were actively being targeted in an attack. He said this is the first time
 There's been an attack against several local governments in a state. He says this is big
 It's a game changer. This will change the model going forward for attackers
 And that will be a problem for governments
 Alan also noted that one advantage texas has is it has a coordinated incident response
 The response team is centralized for cities and counties in emergencies
 Which makes it easier when there is a problem like this to find and reach out to a main contact
 There's someone to call
 Um, so as I said, I said I looked for any update
 As I was putting these notes together yesterday
 Everyone is being quiet. We're not they're now saying that it's 23 individual cities across texas
 but
 That's all we know
 and I
 I shudder to think of of the ransom that is being requested. I mean, well, you know
 Say there are some cities that do have current current backups in our previous reporting of this over the last few months
 we've noted that
 recovering
 from
 an attack like this
 Is sometimes more like without paying ransom is sometimes more expensive than if you pay the ransom
 And you are able to decrypt the systems in place
 just just due to the due to the logistics of
 of having
 Systems which have been there who knows how old they are what software they have on them
 You know how how recent the backups are whether the backups were online and therefore
 Themselves also got encrypted in the process. It's a mess. I mean this really is
 uh an interesting
 Really significant new problem for for us municipalities
 Let me just it's just not exaggerating to to to say that
 So last week we talked
 Uh a lot about the interesting blog that um that Ian beer at google's project zero
 made where uh, he told us about basically what they characterized as
 non discriminating
 Waterhole attacks on a small number of servers
 Targeting specific groups and leo you had some so some information that had just been been made public
 I guess it was in in uh crunch at it, but tech crunch. Yes
 Alex stamos was tweeting about this and he suggested and I think he's probably right that
 Google gave this information on background to tech crunch because apple confirmed it
 Ah, okay. Yes. And in fact, we have some interesting code
 Actually in the show notes that are that that result of from some additional research. I think it was risk iq
 Uh that was able to provide additional detail. So anyway, so what we know is but last week google published
 This their blog about vulnerabilities that apple fixed. Oh, oh i'm sorry what what apple posted
 in there at the end of last week in their newsroom posting
 Was they said
 What I just got a big bright screen on my face uh windows 10 is back up for just rebooting
 Yeah, no ad it did that about five times and yeah, it gave me like we're updating and stuff
 Okay, so i'll turn that big bright screen off. Anyway, so so google said last week
 I mean, sorry apple apple posted the following last week
 Google published a blog about vulnerabilities that apple fixed for ios users in february
 They said we've heard from customers who were concerned by some of the claims
 And we want to make sure all of our customers have the facts
 apple wrote first
 The sophisticated attack was narrowly focused
 Not a broad based exploit of iphones on mass
 As described so apple was pushing back about some of what google was saying
 They wrote the attack affected fewer than a dozen websites that and we'd heard 11
 That focus on content related to and i can't pronounce this. Uh, what's the name of the muslim community?
 It's u i g h you the weaker the weaker is weaker. Yeah, community
 Uighurs community. They said regardless of the scale of the attack. We take the safety and security of all users extremely seriously
 They wrote google's post issued six months after ios patches were released
 Creates the false impression of mass exploitation to quote
 monitor the private activities of entire populations in real time unquote
 Stoking fear among iphone users that their devices had been compromised
 This was never the case wrote apple
 They said second all evidence indicates that these website attacks were only operational for a brief period
 Roughly two months not two years as google implies
 They wrote we fixed the vulnerabilities in question in february working extremely quickly
 Which of course you and i leo made a point of of noting last week to resolve
 The issue just 10 days after we learned about it when google approached us
 We were already in the process of fixing the exploited bugs
 Which we didn't know of if that's the case. They said security
 this is apple is a never-ending journey and our customers can be confident we are working for them
 ios security is unmatched because we take end-to-end responsibility
 For the security of our hardware and software
 Our product security teams around the world are constantly iterating
 To introduce new protections and patch vulnerabilities as soon as they're found
 We will never stop our tireless work to keep our users safe
 So that was their blog posting which
 A lot of a lot of those in the tech community were a little put off by they weren't really super happy with with the tone
 of what apple uh of apple's response
 Last week the head of threat research for risk iq told i told zd net
 For their reporting on this that the attacks were indeed
 Very targeted and that google was wrong in its initial assessment
 Uh, he later shared some thoughts in a public tweet and
 Provided with us with some code very targeted in their regard is well
 It could only have affected the one billion people who are in china
 Exactly
 Exactly
 So yeah, of course, you know as as we know that was the group
 We now we have reason to believe that it was and I think you had said this also last week lee of that
 It was china that no doubt the chinese government that had
 That that had infected some of these sites that was that was looking to pursue some of these groups
 Um, the javascript which was posted as part of uh, risk iq's research
 That you know actually shows them
 pulling the um pulling the the country of the user
 Through javascript looking for a match of the country equal to china
 And if it's a chinese person
 Located an ip address based in china
 Then it injects some additional javascript onto the page after all of this after waiting 60 seconds
 Which then performs this this hack of
 iOS devices
 So and actually I learned a little something from looking at this javascript code. There's a cool site ip.nf
 Which uh
 If you visit if you just put ip.nf into your browser
 It pulls up a description of the api that this site
 Provides and if you put ip.nf/me.json
 What you get back is a little bit of jason, you know javascript object notation
 Where some information about you based on your ip is shown and when I did it. It was extremely accurate
 Uh in its in its location
 And what the script does is it it offers a little bit more
 parameterization its ip.nf forward slash m e dot jason question mark
 Callback equal jason's j s o n s which gives a more detailed result
 Uh of a sort of a full jason hierarchy
 And the then the javascript parses that in order to get the country
 Of origin of the user from which the user is connecting out of the jason
 And if in you know in my case, it said united space states and no doubt for people in china
 It comes back saying china
 Of course smartphone security probably
 You know the most important kind of security for most of us our whole lives are on our smartphones
 And I was you know a little skeptical when apple announced touch id a fingerprint reader and then face id
 But they've proven it can be done. It can be done securely
 Samsung not so much
 Well, and speaking of fingerprints it turns out that the thank you for the segue jason turns out that the
 the sexy ultrasonic finger reader
 Used by samsung's flagship s 10 and note 10 smartphones
 Can be spoofed with a three-dollar screen protector
 Uh at least one that's not made by samsung
 This recently came to light. Although it was not the first time it was observed
 Uh, but it made news when a british woman claimed and others
 Including samsung have since confirmed that after fitting her new phone with a screen protector
 She was then able to unlock her s 10 using any of her fingerprints
 Including ones not enrolled in the phone's authentication system
 And since that made her curious
 She reportedly then asked her husband to try the same thing and his thumbprints worked too
 As did the same trick on her sister's samsung phone. So obviously something was wrong
 samsung's initial response when confender with this was
 We're investigating this internally. We recommend all customers use samsung authorized accessories
 Specifically designed for samsung products
 Then last week in comments to roiters
 samsung admitted the problem was real and said it would release a software patch now
 That's going to be interesting because this seems like a technology problem. Anyway, they said
 We are investigating this issue and will deploying will be deploying a software patch soon
 We encourage any customers with questions or who needs support downloading the latest software to contact us directly
 So
 Okay, the issue with the s 10
 And screen protectors was first noticed when the smartphone was launched back in february of this year
 Um, but the issue failed to acquire critical mass
 Unlike earlier designs, which used a dedicated sensor
 The Qualcomm ultrasonic technology used by samsung
 Is embedded behind the screen and uses high frequency sound ultrasonics
 Which are modulated by the pressure of a user's finger against the screen glass
 It was noticed however that covering the screen with a screen protector could in some instances
 Create an air gap that could interfere with the integrity of the system's ultrasonics
 samsung's advice
 Which still seems a bit flaky to me is to use its brand
 Screen protectors that use they say
 special adhesives that eliminate the possibility of any gap
 so
 To my mind this whole technology seems sketchy at best. Yeah, I I would say
 that ultrasonic
 trans glass
 thumbprint
 reading
 Is not compatible with screen protectors
 That is to say, I I mean
 I think the technology is marginal
 And like when you put your fingerprint right you press your finger directly on the glass
 the idea that you can
 read an image
 through the
 The display technology and all of its intervening electronics
 with some ultrasonic sensor behind there
 and get an image to me that's already amazing
 then the idea that you're going to introduce
 an additional
 uncontrollable layer of goo
 Which is to say adhesive and then a plastic laminate
 in between
 The the glass that is being read
 To me, I mean, I wouldn't be at all surprised if this update
 Actually checks to see if they are able to get an image
 And refuses to operate if there is no image
 Obtainable that is to say if in fact there's an air gap then
 You're not going to actually get anything that looks like a fingerprint and and so probably the technology
 That existed just took whatever it was getting and said
 Okay, that's your you got a weird thumb lady, but fine
 Uh, and then just used it but when in fact it wasn't a thumb
 It was an air bubble that it was resolving and so anybody else pressing on it got the same air bubble
 So
 Maybe what they're going to do is be a lot more
 Discriminating about
 Does this actually look like a finger or not?
 Right and then and just say, uh, no
 and then say, you know buy a real screen protector or
 Sorry, where maybe they'll just decide our technology is not compatible with screen protection
 Good luck get a good case. Um, I don't know. Yeah, we'll see how that goes
 Yeah, and to me it to me it feels like they've hit a bump a big bump in their fundamental
 Um, biometric technology and really this sort of speaks to the larger issue that I just sort of wanted to address
 which is that
 You know
 We're we're always talking on this podcast about
 the the trade-off between convenience and security
 you know a long
 impossible to memorize
 password is incredibly inconvenient and
 Incredibly secure
 If you otherwise manage it correctly if it is really long and full of gibberish
 You know if it's it's high entropy uses all the available characters
 That's a really really that's really strong protection and and
 and
 It can although it isn't used to identify someone because
 Because we're not we can't prevent them from using monkey one two three
 If it actually were a like if it had
 256 bits of entropy
 It could be used to securely authenticate someone. I mean it's that good
 Whereas notice that
 That the biometrics we're using today. They're not identifying someone. They're confirming
 a presumed identification
 That's a far lower bar
 to
 to meet
 For example, one you know time-based tokens that you know that the six digits that change every 30 seconds
 Similarly, they don't identify you. They only confirm your presumed identity
 Which again is a much lower bar to meet so
 So the biometric systems that we have today
 They're making a go-no-go decision. You know they assume
 They they like who it is they've been trained on someone's face
 And so they're looking out at the person going hmm
 Does this look like granny or not and
 and making a go-no-go decision so
 So we're what we're asking for is far lower
 Determination determinism
 than
 Having them look out and go oh, that's john from down the street and then like loading his account or something no
 You know, this is a simple. Yes. No decision being made and even so
 It is very problematic. Do you know jason and I didn't track the the technology in the pixel 4
 We know because I was following it when apple came out with their face id
 All this fancy 3d camera stuff how they like paint a dot grid
 An IR dot grid
 Out on the person's face in order to make it
 To require it to be 3d
 And then they they like do a full like multiple stereo vision
 Rendering thing that does the pixel 4 have all of that. Yeah, the pixel 4 is the first
 Pixel to do that actually and I think that was part of
 I mean for what I understand that was part of the reason why google got rid of the fingerprint
 Sensor altogether because they felt confident enough in that collection. So it's very similar to apples approach
 It sounds like one of the main things that's missing from the pixel 4 in the apple approach is the eyes open
 detection
 Which is a pretty yeah, and you know, you would not think you would not think given all the awesome
 Technology that google has in that phone. I mean I watched their presentation. I was like holy crap
 I mean, there's a lot of stuff in there
 You think it could tell whether someone's eyes are open or not. I mean a dog can well
 Yeah, what's interesting also, but maybe this doesn't have anything to do with the eyes is there's another setting in android settings called screen aware
 Or something like that
 And it's a setting that when it's activated it can tell when you're looking at your phone in order to keep the display from timing out
 But now that I say that like it might just be that you're facing the phone not that your eyes are open
 Um if it's your eyes are open then it's like, okay
 Already got the detection going on like and that sounds like that was a pre pixel 4 thing
 Too, right? Yeah, the phones have had that for a while some phones have had that. I don't know that the pixels had that though
 Oh, okay. Yeah, I think that's a new feature of the pixels. So interesting, but yeah
 Yeah, I wouldn't be surprised if uh, you know in light of this with the um
 with the ultrasonic fingerprint sensor
 Allowing anyone's fingerprint to let someone in based on this the screen protector that's installed
 If samsung then ends up going in you know, maybe they're already working on this
 Going in the same route as as apple and the same route as as google with the pixel 4
 And this just becomes another reason why they then get rid of the the fingerprint sensor and go iron face
 Do I remember leo saying that he was not happy with the performance of the s tens sensor look like it does take a while to
 Yes to operate. Yeah. Yeah, I think leo and I share the same opinion and it wasn't just the s 10
 In display. Well, no, sorry. It was the note 10 and the s 10 both have the in display
 A fingerprint sensor and it's the ultrasonic of course different from what we've seen a lot of other in display fingerprint sensors b
 Which was optical and like the one plus seven t and seven plus or seven pro
 They have an optical in display fingerprint sensor that is super responsive and super quick and works almost every time
 The s 10 and the note uh 10
 In my experience and I think leo would agree is just really like it. It works half the time
 It's hard to get it just right. It's you know, you do it and it's like press a little harder press a little
 It just it doesn't work nearly as effectively
 Interesting. So it's supposedly the better more secure solution. Yeah, so though you are able to do an in screen optical sensor
 That's cool. I didn't know I didn't realize that there were those around. I agree. That would be great
 But but again
 Everybody's got a camera already looking out the front of the phone
 The problem of course is that it's 2d and you absolutely need to have 3d in order to
 You know up the ante and try to determine whether this is a live or or you know static
 Person so right, you know, so everybody's being and who knows
 I mean we've already seen like 3d modeling of faces and all kinds of other stuff that you're able to to do
 Once you've got 3d camera technology looking out at you
 So it just sort of seems like that's the direction everyone's going to go in
 And of course the other problem
 uh that we didn't talk about but we have in the past when we're discussing biometrics is is
 A super super complex long password
 Which can be used to uniquely identify you and is incredibly robust and secure
 Can be changed
 You cannot change your face. You cannot change your you cannot change your fingerprints
 So on the one hand your face and your fingerprint are something you always have with you
 The problem is there's something you always have with you
 And like for life rather than just you know for your current excursion from the house
 so uh
 I always tend to fall back on on like multiple points of authentication like I always wondered why
 If if the fingerprint sensor on a phone is so ubiquitous and now you know now we're kind of heading out of out of that trend
 It seems like getting rid of it, but if it's so ubiquitous, why can't I have it so that I'm using my fingerprint sensor when I enter my my pin
 And those combined to say hey, he knows the right digits and his fingerprint is the right one
 This is the right person if people really want to be just that extra level of secure or fingerprint sensor along with face face scanning
 Why can't they both combine and I I feel like now that I'm saying it that we've talked about it before
 One of the points that maybe you mentioned is if one of those things is out of whack it makes it incredibly difficult for you to ever get into your device
 Maybe that was you. I can't remember. Maybe it was something else, but yeah
 Yeah, and in fact, I do remember you and I talking about that and that's the that's the other problem is that we've got
 You got multiple factors
 And they're all a little bit soft
 So right you know, so you have on one hand you don't want to false
 Positive so you so you don't want to allow somebody in who should not get in
 Nor do you want a false negative you don't want to prevent the authorized user from getting in when they want to get him
 I mean, that's very frustrating. I remember I think it was the very first
 Was the very first touch ID something that apple did just wasn't working that well when when they first released it
 I was like, uh
 You know, and like, you know, it was required. I think it was the very first touch ID or maybe I
 I later figured out how to over train it and I think that's what it was
 I was able to over train it and then bring its reliability up where I wanted to uh, where I wanted it to be
 but but again because it's a
 Heuristic system that's inherently making a judgment call
 Does this look enough like the person i've seen before because of course our faces are changing subtly?
 over time, our hands pick up damage from the environment cuts and scrapes and things sometimes
 You know, so it's am I sure enough about who this is?
 But if it was a super high entropy password, it's not a matter of being sure enough
 It's like holy crap. That's got to be the person because nobody else could get down
 Yes could could get this right, right? And so so
 You know what we're dealing with you know, the the more soft decisions we make
 the the
 softer the overall
 Compound decision becomes and that means that that we become more likely to false positive or false negative
 And that doesn't help anybody either. So
 You know, I
 It really it seems very clear that biometrics is the future people want the convenience
 the only thing I would suggest to people and we've said this on this podcast before is
 Give your phone to other people stick your phone and other people's faces see if it unlocks for them
 Have other people challenge your fingerprint reader gets do know develop some some a priori
 Real-world experience with how robust this is. Yeah, I mean, I don't think enough people do that
 You know, you know, you know, nobody tell nobody asks someone else to like try guessing my password on my phone
 That's just you know, we know that's not going to happen
 But you know, it'd be really interesting to get some actual sense
 For for whether you know other people whose faces will open your phone
 I love this next story. Oh my god. Yes, it's such a great story. So
 Five months after returning his rental car
 The the brief renter of the car
 Still has full remote control
 He can track the vehicle
 Remotely lock and unlock it and start and stop its engine
 So the story is that when
 Masamba Sinclair rented a Ford expedition from enterprise last May
 He was excited to connect it to
 To connect with its
 Ford pass
 The Ford pass app allows drivers to use their phones
 To remotely start and stop the engine lock and unlock the doors and track the vehicle's precise location
 What could possibly go wrong?
 So he's 34 years old
 And he told the people I think it was ours who was doing the reporting on this he said
 I enjoyed it
 And logged into Ford pass to be able to access vehicle features from my phone
 Such as locking and unlocking and starting the engine. I liked the idea of it more than I found it useful
 He says the UI looks good and works well
 So today
 Sinclair's opinion of mobile apps and rental cars is decidedly less favorable
 That's because
 Five months after he returned the vehicle on May 31
 His app continues to have control
 Over the car despite multiple other people having since rented the SUV in the intervening months
 Ford pass
 Still allows Sinclair to track the location of the vehicle lock and unlock it start and stop its engine
 Sinclair has brought the matter to Ford's attention
 Both through its website and multiple times on twitter so far
 Ford has done nothing to end his access
 He said
 All it took for me to initially connect was to download the app and enter the VIN
 That's you know the VIN number on on the engine then he says then
 Confirming connectivity through the infotainment system
 There might be a way to disassociate my phone from the car itself
 He says, but that hasn't happened yet and it's crazy to put the onus on renters
 To have to do that anyway
 He says I have had no problems at all and I've even unlocked the doors and started the engine
 When I could see that the vehicle was at the mazula airport rental parking lot
 Wow, so we have in the show notes three of his tweets the first on joan june fourth
 He says to app ford. He says I can still track and unlock the expedition that I rented last week via the Ford pass app
 Huge safety concern for all future renters. I submitted a solution via ford new ideas
 There's a new idea to solve this and it was denied
 This needs to be fixed. He has in all caps and then he had he posts a
 Pick the next day he tweets. It's day five since I returned my rental
 And now someone else has rented it out
 Do I need to start remotely unlocking it until they also start to complain?
 please fix this exclamation point and
 Looks like a week later june 14th. I returned to this car
 He's tweeting to ford. I returned this car two weeks ago
 And you've shown no willingness to allow rental companies to remove my access to unlock it and start the engine
 Maybe i'll just start randomly unlocking it
 Hopefully he doesn't hopefully don't do that
 Yeah, don't do that
 Ford pass is offered as we know by the ford motor company and is available for both ios and android devices
 It's one of several apps for connecting to ford vehicles
 the less than intuitive means for unparing a vehicle and phone
 Not to mention the difficulty in knowing a device remains connected
 represents a serious
 Security and privacy risk and not to mention to renters but to people buying
 a vehicle second hand imagine you buy it, you know from car max or something and
 Don't know or particularly care that the the previous owner still has access
 Um while ford said infotainment screens will indicate when a device is paired
 It's obvious that multiple enterprise employees and renters. Okay. This was remember. This is what six months ago
 Multiple enterprise employees and renters have continued to miss the warning
 Even now after the reporter of this
 Discuss the problem with both enterprise and ford representatives
 Sinclair's access still has not been revoked
 Sinclair said i've been opening the app and tracking the vehicle almost every day
 To see if my access is still there and sure enough. I can see exactly where my old rental
 affectionately named the beast he wrote is
 At any given moment this means that I can not only find this rental car
 Whenever I want but I can also unlock the doors and help myself to anything that might be
 Inside since proximity and this is me thinking now since proximity to the infotainment system
 Was required initially to complete the initial pairing
 Authorization and authentication
 And since occasional proximity
 Would be expected would be an expected characteristic for any actual car owner
 It would seem to me that a useful security trade-off would be to have a device be forgotten
 If it hasn't been within physical proximity
 Of the vehicle's infotainment system for I don't know what a week or two
 I mean it sounds like repairing isn't that burdensome and
 You know a car owner they're going to be in their car every day, right?
 Or you know, maybe they only drive it on the weekends. Okay, so make it two weeks and after two weeks
 Forget the thing or or maybe after one week
 make like flash a warning and say
 You have you know this device has not been near the car for the last week
 Please confirm you want to keep it paired. So make it a you know an affirmative
 Statement of of pairing endurance, right? And if you don't do that it unpairs. I mean, it's nuts
 Yeah, I'm curious about this forecast thing because this actually
 Reminds me of like a question I've had when I do rent a car and they have the infotainment system
 And I want to play my music through the bluetooth
 So that requires pairing so then as a renter you end up pairing to this thing
 And maybe you know, maybe you choose not to share your contacts with the system
 I usually don't do that. You know, don't share the contacts because hope that seems like a really bad idea
 But I'm sure a lot of people just say yeah, whatever connect it and then they don't think to remove it
 So I mean and I I guess there should be some sort of mode in these things for rental car agencies for them to you know
 On their turnaround because even what you're talking about steve is somebody rents at the very next day
 That still doesn't prevent this other third party from locking the door or turning off the vehicle at the wrong time or whatever
 It's a liability
 There needs to be some easy way for them to be able to deactivate that if that doesn't exist already
 Maybe it does and they're just not using it
 Well or in in in the rental mode
 It would be reasonable to turn down the the forget the device delay to one day
 Right because you know and anyone who's renting a car is in it like, you know, yep a lot
 So and if not
 Oh, oh boo-hoo if you're if your device
 I mean, besides who wants to unlock their doors remotely. I mean, okay, maybe who wants to start the engine remotely?
 Uh
 Okay, it's called outside. I don't get understand. Maybe these are all like gee whiz doohickey
 You know, yeah, I have it because the because i'm on the internet, you know, right my car is an iot
 Well, we already know what a bad idea that is
 As you can see on security now steve covers
 everything from
 Security breaches hacks things to watch out for to of course privacy and uh, we plan to do
 All of that again in 2020 steve has a great agenda of things to cover
 You'll get the latest
 News about security and steve will also explain a lot of technologies that frankly for most of us are
 Kind of mysterious. That's what steve's so great at we'll be back next week
 I hope you will too, and we thank you so much for letting us be a part of your listening all year long
 I'm leo la porta behalf of steve gibson happy new year and we'll see you in 2020
 You
