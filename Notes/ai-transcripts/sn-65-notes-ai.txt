 This is Security Now with Steve Gibson episode 65 for November 9th 2006.
 Why is security so difficult?
 Security Now is brought to you by a starrow makers of the starrow security gateway on
 the web at www dot a s t a r o dot com and by del for this week's specials visit twit
 dot TV slash del time to talk security with my my personal security hero Steve Gibson a
 man who I trust implicitly if Steve says do it I do it it's good to talk to you yeah
 great to be back that's a heavy burden do you feel like that's a tough no because you
 know I spend a lot of time thinking about this stuff I'm I'm involved in it I love the
 technology I mean I'm you know I'm a I'm a technology junkie and and you know much as
 once upon a time hard drives had this problem and I used my love of technology to deal with
 that what's been right now you know the next real big that a big deal with the internet
 has been security yeah so you know I've I've sort of rolled my sleeves up and you know did
 did shields up and of course you know got into this whole spyware thing and and malware
 we really have to thank you and at this point you don't make any products which in a way
 for security which in a way to me gives you more credibility I mean if semantics says
 viruses are on the upswing I always have to think well hmm who benefits from that but
 when you say and I know that you're not benefiting from it this is and I also know how scribble
 it you scribulous you are about facts that this this is an issue yeah well the only the
 only criticism sometimes you get is that you're like chicken little that sometimes you over
 state the security issues do you have a defense for yourself in that regard well yeah and we've
 sort of talked about this I'm when we're doing this I'm trying to say to people look you
 know not everybody is the same in fact we're about to talk about yet another Microsoft
 zero day exploit which is on the net it's a it's a active X control and so last time we
 talked about this I was very careful to say and and I hope our listeners heard me say you
 know if you're a person who serves with scripting enabled if you're using IE if you go to you
 know random sites that you don't know often then this is probably worth worrying about
 right whereas you know if any of those things are not true you know if basically you hang
 out on MSN or or or Amazon or you know you're you're you're you're breadth of reach with
 your browser is not extreme then you can probably wait for Microsoft to catch up with
 their next security patch and you know when presumably they'll fix it so you know I'm
 you know as we've said before you you you can be bitten by things you're not aware of and
 I'm sure from looking at all the feedback we get that people want to know and they'll
 let you know they respect the fact that we're trusting them to decide whether this is something
 they want to deal with or not I mean leader remember here you and I are not with any antiviral
 software on our machine so it's not like don't tell anybody I don't want to go after me so
 I mean which most people thinks isn't or think is nuts because you know what we're doing well
 yes and so I guess my my point is not like we're sitting here you know pumping out fear
 and worry and and feeling that the the idea is to say look the here are the facts clearly
 and and and and flatly as we can provide them and we let people figure out how they feel
 about it right and then you you be the judge you decide what you want to do that in in
 irata from from prior weeks I did want to mention that remember that we had some discussion about
 remote access to Gmail using pop an SMTP right and I wanted to confirm that that Google Google
 mail does absolutely allow you to configure your regular mail client with secure connections
 using SSL to connect to Gmail servers so that you can have exactly the same experience that
 you would normally have with Gmail going to your web browser and opening Gmail you get
 the same same interactivity with your own email client just setting up an account on your email
 client to go and fetch and send your mail through Gmail so it's very cool now some we
 actually this came up on the cruise we were talking about SSL security was a big topic
 of discussion of course as you might imagine and somebody pointed out I think one of the
 editors of Mac world pointed out probably Dan freaks that some online mail accounts let
 you use SSL to log in but then are unencrypted once you're transferring mail and some are
 not like web browser based yeah hotmail that kind of thing well yes and in fact the way
 Google works is if you go to Google with a non-HTTPS URL that is just the HTTP colon slash
 slash mail dot lot Google dot com right you will briefly go secure while you're logging
 in then you'll notice in your address bar your subsequent use of Google is just over
 regular connection but you can go there deliberately with a secure HTTPS colon slash mail dot Google
 dot com and it recognizes you've done you've done that and it will leave you with a with
 a permanently secure connection for all your transactions that I'm just doing it right now
 and so it stays HTTPS if you start HTTPS and that's the key if you see that as you know
 you're all right right all right that's good to know so and you can use it for a SMTP as
 well which is kind of cool yes you can work so you're not you're not only able to remotely
 pull your mail but you can send mail and I because I wanted to give this a try I used
 my Gmail account from my normal windows you know because I'm an old you door user and
 they have a knowledge base article that I'm going to put a link to on our show notes for
 this show that that shows you for all the different clients that they know of and my my
 version of you door a 5.1 which is a bit older than than where you door is now it was covered
 step by step screenshots showing you how to configure your client in order to do this
 and then I looked at the mail that went through Gmail from from an anonymous standpoint that
 is you know was the IP from which I originated this available and the answer is no so it is
 and it provides some a nice layer of anonymity in the same way that like going to some location
 and and using a browser to to do the Gmail transaction would excellent it's very nice I
 just wanted to confirm to people that you know remote access to Gmail is possible from
 an email client and it's it requires you to be secure security is there I don't even think
 you can turn it off when you're using remote access that way very cool we also have a big
 zero day exploit as you mentioned in well I'm actually not sure how big it is yet I dug
 around and I looked and it looks like this one is if nothing else this is a slower start
 than we've seen before on the other hand you know people are actively looking that is hackers
 are actively looking for ways into people's machines so it is certainly a concern this
 is not it's interesting this is not an XML parsing bug in something that that IE was meant
 to use such as the last one but it is an XML problem the idea is there something called
 XML core services which is an active X control which Microsoft provides so that so the developers
 of Windows software can add XML awareness to their applications ah but but because it's
 an active X control IE is able to invoke it because IE is you know unless you you otherwise
 limit IE it's able to access any active X controls in your system so so the exploit for
 this and there is exploit code on the net and it is being actively exploited to install
 malware in people's machines so it's worth knowing this is a zero day exploit which as
 we know means that the first awareness of the problem was what occurred when someone
 discovered it already being used so you know zero day if it was you know it was found out
 in use and it's being used to install malware at this point it has not seen widespread use
 but we can presume it's going to be now Microsoft's second Tuesday of the month is next Tuesday
 which doesn't provide Microsoft with much of a window in which to fix this you know based
 on how long Microsoft tends to take so I don't know for sure they're gonna they're gonna
 lock this thing down next Tuesday if they don't then this has a great a much greater
 opportunity to grow a lot and and spread in the meantime now if you use your protection
 technique to protect you if you still want to use IE and Steve uses IE but he uses the
 trusted and untrusted zone settings to protect himself that would work in this case wouldn't
 it absolutely the I mean and that's what I like about this so much is you know as I've
 talked about it I'm wherever I go on the net I am locked down I've got the internet zone
 set to high security and then I've got my trusted zone set to medium which is the default
 security and then for sites where I want them to work that is if I go somewhere and it doesn't
 work and I look around and it's like okay this is worth lowering my guard for and I
 mean that's what you're doing if you're gonna allow a site's scripting to run in your browser
 you're lowering your guard then I I add that URL to my trusted zone as it's called in IE
 and so what happens is unknown sites are always always maximum security with scripting disabled
 and it's only sites that I have chosen to trust that you know we're scripting then runs
 and so yes I would be protected by default in that situation now of course if I made
 the mistake of trusting something that I should not then that's still a problem so it's not
 like this is like like doing this means you never need to worry about Microsoft code ever
 again I mean you still do it's not a panacea key to by the way to this and to a lot of
 security a settings including firewalling is you start by denying everything and then
 you then you explicitly add sites rather than vice versa slowly taking sites off the list
 you you deny active X to everybody at first it's funny because original firewall logic
 that when when firewalls were brand new something bad would happen and the IT administrators
 would block that port kind of closing the barn door after the horse had bolted well I
 mean that the logic was reversed it was the old fashioned logic of block a problem rather
 than permitting only the things that you know you want and of course that's completely
 flipped over now so that you know firewalls are are blocking everything by default and
 then only allowing traffic in which they've been that they've been told to and configured
 to right so in the case of this active X exploit there is something in IE which we've talked
 about before called the kill bit the kill bit is basically is basically a a permission
 for IE to access any active X control active X controls are identified internally with
 one of these Microsoft Windows GUIDS the GU ID the globally unique ID which is I'm sure
 when people see it they go oh yeah I've seen this before yeah it's weird too because I'm
 seeing them surfacing more and more on what I'm surfing around Microsoft site you're I'm
 like seeing these GUIDS printed out and they there are a lot of them in Vista also where
 I'm seeing them I don't know if this is going to go away once we go to final RTM code or
 if Microsoft is intending to begin exposing users to these bizarre old serial number looking
 things but but anyway the point is that there again on our show notes page for for for this
 show number 65 I have a link to a little registry script that anyone can download you simply
 run that it'll pop up a dialogue same because it says dot R E G is the extension pops up
 a dialogue saying do you want to install this in your registry and what this is this little
 script and then this is directly from Microsoft's page and I also have a link to that to Microsoft's
 page so people can go back to the original source also all this does is add an entering
 the registry to turn on the kill bit for IE for this particular control there's there's
 no reason that IE would ever be expected to use this particular active X control unlike
 the prior the real XML parsing active X control where we had the problem last time so I'm
 is this something you this prevent all active X execution what does kill bit do no it's it
 prevents I ease use of this particular active X control just this control is disabled just
 just this control where the problem was found on it and that and that's why I was talking
 about that this wacky GUID is that it's identified the active X control is identified by one
 of these bizarre you know curly brace and then I think it's eight hex characters a hyphen
 then a couple more groups of four hex characters and so forth in order to like make up this
 weird globally unique ID so each activist control has this ID and right you set the kill bit
 individually for each ID exactly got it so you're going to find you don't you need to
 know that it's actually a CLS ID I think they call it when it's an active X control you need
 to find that ID number and then in your registry and then turn the kill bit off or better yet
 use this script it'll do it automatically for well actually and it may not be in the
 registry the it may or may not already be there oh you do need you do need to add I see I get
 in order to add in order to add this this optional kill bit and then that'll prevent
 IE from having access to it got it got it and then the last thing I want to mention is something
 I've talked to you about before this is just in the errata section and this is a program
 that I just want to tell our listeners about because I'm I can't live without it now and
 I learned about it from from seeing it demoed last time I was on on the call for help show
 with you Leo up in Toronto and that's a little piece of freeware called all snap all snap
 really a fan of this and what brought it back again Mikey discovered this one yeah what brought
 back again is that I was talking to my tech support guy Greg on the phone yesterday and
 we were you know covering our you know sort of catching up on on on on various GRC stuff
 and he said at the end of our conversation and you know what I can no longer live without
 and I said all snap he said yes because he's he's anal in sort of the way I am you know
 I was telling you I spent all this time adjusting the position of my windows so that the you
 know they're exactly on the edge of the screen and all all snap does is makes the edges of
 windows and other application windows sticky so that any and we've seen these in some apps
 have a UI where where their own windows will be sort of snappy that's like snap to it to
 the edge of your screen or in the upper corner just to sort of place themselves for you what
 this does is this just installs a global hook in windows that that provides the sticky functionality
 to your entire OS experience anyway just if anyone puts a l l s n a p just all one word
 all snap into Google it'll take you to the the the programmers site and to a free downloads
 page and it's very clean when I use a windows I have a whole bunch of windows machines and
 I think they all now except I think I won XP machine that doesn't yet whenever I'm using
 one and the windows don't snap it's like okay I've you know I'm gonna install this right
 now before I go any further because I just I love it so much we'll put a link in the show
 notes to since people obviously want this yeah I'm wondering if I get I need one from
 the Mac just exactly I mean I wish the Mac had it well it's probably pretty easy to write
 so I'm sure somebody will do that just for you Steve if so I want to know about it because
 it would be great at the Mac had it too all snap so I wanted to talk today about about
 something I've been that I've had in my mind for months because I've been trying to figure
 out when I'm like talking to my friends and family you know we're talking about you know
 the the war in Iraq and you know whether it's made us more safe or less safe and and and
 denial of service attacks and like and why you know why there isn't anything people can
 do we were talking about this you know you and I Leo just just the other day and and
 and also similarly like this new active X zero day exploit I mean all of this is sort
 of why is security so difficult and and I finally I think came up with a sort of a way
 of of framing an answer that I really like because you know as I'm talking to friends
 you know they know I'm into computer security and it's like well you know why why is it
 such a problem let me and when you frame it that way do you mean why is it so difficult
 to make a secure operating system or why is it so difficult for end users to secure themselves
 no why is it so difficult for the United States to be secure back so I mean why is it so
 tough to be to make something secure yes why is security not and I'm glad you asked the
 question because I want to make sure I mean like everything you know that you know against
 terrorism against denial of service attacks which is sort of a form of terrorism against
 active X controls having bugs in them why is it why is this so hard what you know what's
 the problem and and I you know I mean I I knew sort of in my guts just intuitively but
 I was it was interesting I was having a hard time communicating it and so I spent a lot
 of time trying to figure out how to explain to people what the problem is and and I come
 up with something that I like because I think it begins to address that and so so I define
 security as the absence of all insecurity and I and I think that's that makes sense yeah
 it's all right so well and so and so if you think about that so security is the absence
 of of all or any insecurity eliminating all danger or in the case of computers eliminating
 all chances of loss of privacy loss of liberty or eliminating all bugs well that's that's
 the problem with computers isn't it exactly and so I mean that begins to take us towards
 an understanding of why we continually have these problems is that it's you know and it's
 also why I mean I really like this because the more I think about this definition security
 is the absence of any and all insecurity it then for example answers Steve bombers famous
 outrage about why do we still have all these buffer overrun bugs I mean it it it says the
 only way to be secure is to have absolutely nothing that's not secure because anything
 that is not secure obviously creates an opportunity for insecurity so so you know it's well understood
 that that that software has bugs I mean you know and I've heard I cringe when I hear people
 say oh well all software has bugs because I mean you know I take it personally because
 I'm a software developer and and I would like to imagine that that my software at least
 doesn't have bugs but but the fact is this software is incredibly complex as I've certainly
 said before that's you know that's that's my defense for this but I've I've in thinking
 about this more in the context of security I realized there are two different classes
 of software bugs there are there are there are bugs and problems that users stumble over
 in normal use that is you're using some application and it does something wrong and it's like
 oh okay I mean and and frankly I'm sure any any one who uses windows and PCs in general
 has just sort of become accustomed to that you know software that they use oftentimes
 you know freeware share where that they've downloaded that that's going to perform some
 useful utilitarian task there'll be something about it that just kind of doesn't work right
 and it's like okay and you know you you close it and restart it you figure out a work around
 yourself maybe you report the problem but you know we're we're encountering them all
 the time so one class of bugs are those sorts of things the things we stumble over in normal
 use but a very different kind of bug are those which which manifest themselves from deliberate
 abuse that is deliberately doing something that the software author didn't expect didn't
 plan for didn't protect against and and it's it's fundamentally different than that that
 is to try to find problems than to stumble on them when you're not trying to find them
 because it's there is just the nature of the software we're using is that it is I mean
 and to finish that sentence that it is so complicated I mean and if nothing else demonstrates that
 just look at the size of the code now that we're loading on onto our machines you know
 it used to be I mean we all remember the day where you would buy a software product and
 it had a couple floppy disks you know a couple one point four four meg discets now nothing
 doesn't come on on anything but CDs and it's you know it's hundreds of megs and so there's
 just there's so much more code and so much more opportunity for mistakes so so this notion
 that that software could appear to be fine if it's functionally okay yet still have exploitable
 problems if if someone were actively trying to find them and of course that is what hackers
 are doing today now now the reason we're seeing so many problems with internet explorer now
 is that there are two ways that hackers have access to us either they come to us or or we
 come to them now the traditional big problems that we saw in the earlier days of windows
 was actually before service pack two were you know were worms code red and nimda and
 blaster and the these big worm problems well worms were things that came to us that is
 they they were a real problem because they were inherently able to exploit an opening
 that existed in a large base of windows platforms in order to attack the computer remotely they
 came to us the the reason that XP service pack to with such a win is it Microsoft finally
 turned on the firewall by default so that so that no longer unless something you know
 special was done but in any event you wouldn't you would no longer have a the default majority
 population of windows machines accepting unsolicited incoming traffic well in one day
 I mean in the day that service pack to turned on the firewall the huge problem of they come
 to us ended and I mean and things are like way better ever since it just fixed it just
 in you know overnight and so you know as I was saying for years before that I didn't
 I don't blame Microsoft for mistakes I was I was upset with them for policy and their
 policy was to have all these services running with open ports they mean literally creating
 the they come to us trouble which they finally thing goodness ended by turning a firewall
 on by default and of course way before that anybody that was following along with with
 the good idea of running a Nat router a Nat router of course being a hardware firewall
 in the sense that any incoming traffic is just dropped unless it's expected that that
 also would have terminated the them come to us trouble but on the other hand as the success
 of the worms demonstrated back in those those worm years the huge bulk of windows machines
 were not behind any kind of firewall those Microsoft services were exposed and they were
 coming to us now what we're left with then is the the reverse model today and I don't
 see this going away anytime soon unfortunately and that is the we come to them and that of
 course is all the current exploits and troubles that we've been talking about are are inherently
 we come to them and of course the way we come is with our browser that's the way the computer
 extends itself out onto the Internet makes it a lot easier for hackers they don't have
 to come to us anymore well it's it's it's it's it's it's easier from the standpoint of they
 lay traps which some number of users fall into but it is certainly the case that the number
 of machines affected by any of these traps is inherently going to be much smaller because
 you know no super popular high volume website you know Google Amazon MSN so forth you know
 Cnet you know none of these big sites are under control of hackers you know certainly
 it's it's conceivable that they could have a problem that a site could get some malicious
 code installed on it that would affect a lot of people in a short time but that's you know
 that's the exception rather than the rule so so it is worth mentioning especially in the
 context Leo you are saying of like you know us crying wolf or the sky is falling it's
 worth noting that it's only people who are generally venturing out and want to poke into
 dark corners of the Internet well they are exposing them but I have to point out there
 have been cases my space leaps to mind a perfect example where yes 50 million people frequent
 this my space is one of the most popular spy spaces on the net and is absolutely a place
 a vector for infection yeah that's a very good point and so there is a place where the the
 we come to them model can can still infect a huge population of users so so anyway I I
 really liked I really liked finally coming up with a way to to explain to my non computer
 savvy friends you know why security is such a problem it's that to know to really be secure
 you must really be secure which means no opportunity for insecurity and of course then computer
 savvy people understand what that really means I mean that means it's impossible you must
 have bug free software right and that's just well no one sees that happening if I if I were
 to boil this down in a soccer team terms perhaps it's axiomatic well first of all you did you
 define security is the absence of insecurity and the only way to be secure is to have nothing
 that is insecure in other words no bugs it's axiomatic that all software has bugs and since
 bugs often create security holes all software is inherently insecure well and it it's worth
 noting too that that this recent zero day exploit was an interesting lesson because a component
 that was not IE that is a windows core service component that was invocable by IE was where
 the problem was found and so again the we come to them model which would would otherwise
 not be useful for example I'm you know I'm looking right now at a stopwatch app sitting
 here telling us how long they they show has been going on well it may have bugs it may
 have exploitable bugs but I'm not going out on the internet with my little stopwatch application
 so the fact that it's got some problems doesn't hurt me it doesn't represent any kind of a
 problem now now that problem though in windows because so much of it is is available to IE
 I mean once you put the browser as an integral part of the operating system you're really
 in in many ways making things worse well windows has become componentized and that you know
 and that's what they call you know Olay then became active X and it is a an inherently
 a component it's designed to be a network aware operating system and IE is always running
 you cannot not have it running well if the other thing worth mentioning is that I mentioned
 my little stopwatch app that is not on the net one of the things that we see happening
 is that mainstream applications may be on the net yes they dial they phone home more and
 more mainstream applications are adding internet connectivity and internet features because
 they're looking for ways you know as they get past version four it's like okay how are
 we going to sell more of this we need to you know add more features well everything's
 network these days everything's the internet and connectivity and peer to peer and all that
 so so the next the next level of problem after windows if windows ever really becomes
 bolted down enough that it's not the majority target we're going to see the network enabled
 applications which are the most popular begin to be the next round of attack target and
 and then it's not just Microsoft that needs to be really careful and really aware of bugs
 it's all third party programmers right and I don't ever I don't ever see that happening
 yeah wow I think you know for a while the department of defense tried to solve this problem with
 bulletproof languages Ada for instance that kind of forced the whole idea of Ada was a
 bug free language that forced programmers to not make errors I don't know what happened
 to Ada well maybe it was maybe it was undoable I don't know next week's topic is Vista security
 oh boy I've delved in and spent some time because I want to follow up on on this week's
 issue of like okay if if security is the complete absence of all insecurity where is
 Microsoft going in with their own security initiatives and what's been what's been added
 to Vista and what's the difference between 32 bit and 64 bit platforms and I got some
 surprising news there so good that's what we're going to do next week well now we know why
 security is so difficult in fact I think you might have said why is security impossible
 impossible I'm afraid yeah and it's I get and as you've always said it's a process there
 is no end to securing yourself it's a process and it's not like the hundred thousand listeners
 we have of security now are all going to get their machines destroyed it's that in arguably
 some percentage of Windows users are being infected and it's not a small percentage every
 day I recently saw something that said two thirds of of average Windows computers have
 spyware and malware installed on them of some sort yeah I mean I know just from doing
 the KFI radio show that it's endemic we know one has an exact number although the study
 I've seen as you say are far more than half and but just just anecdotally from talking
 to people that's the number one concern of Windows users they spyware and viruses are
 it and it's not hysteria it's it's a very real problem yeah and again if it's not like
 it affects everyone you know the the old days with the worms where we if they weren't behind
 firewalls where we had the they come to us model well we know you stick an unpatched
 XP machine on the net and it's compromised in minutes right I mean that's that's the case
 today but all all current XP machines are behind a firewall and hopefully behind in
 that router so that's just not a problem you know the they come to us is over but we've
 still got this we come to them and and we're coming to them more and we're coming baby
 hey thank you Steve want to thank our sponsors Astaro corporation they know that security is
 a process and they make it possible for big business little business and even home users
 to be secure with the Astaro security gateway if you're a smaller medium business network
 that needs superior protection from spam viruses and hackers as well as complete VPN capabilities
 intrusion protection content filtering and an industrial strength firewall all in a very
 easy to use high performance appliance contact Astaro AST ARO dot com is a link on our show
 notes makes it easy to get there you can call them 877 the number four AST ARO to schedule
 a free trial of an Astaro security gateway appliance in your business I have a 120 and
 I cannot tell you how fantastic it is it is it is incredible based on open source built
 to withstand anything and if you're a non business user by the way you can get it for free the
 software version at Astaro dot com install it running on a annual PC box and you'll get
 the same benefits pay us small I think it's 79 euros a year small fee and you can have
 all of the the antivirus and spam and so forth too I think I want to see I expect to see
 more and more people with home networks using Astaro to protect the entire network it really
 is a great solution AST ARO dot com we thank them for major financial support for security
 now we also want to thank the folks at Dell for providing major financial support d-e-l-l
 dot com actually the best way to go is probably to go through twit dot tv we have a special
 Dell page if you just click the link at twit dot tv or go to twit dot tv slash Dell we have
 some pics there but don't be don't be just limited to those anything you want from Dell
 if you go through those links we get credit for anything you purchase if you're buying
 a windows PC getting ready for Vista Dell has some great stuff I love this XPS 700 you
 know I'm just I'm about to buy one now that they have the the Vista Express upgrades I
 think it's time to pull the trigger and get that XPS 700 I've been I've been eyeing for
 so long twit dot tv slash Dell we thank them for their support Steve Gibson's website is
 grc.com that's the place where you can find security now show notes thanks to Elaine and
 the 16 kilobits versions for the bandwidth impaired we had a lot of show notes today particularly
 to all snap and we'll put in a link to I have a link and I'm going to put it in the show
 notes to your guide to using IE safely I wrote it up at one point with the pictures and everything
 so I'll put that in the show notes and the kill bit I want to call it kill bill the kill
 bit you might want to kill bill after all the kill bit registry patch with apologies to
 Quentin Tarantino and and more at grc.com that's also where you'll find spin right and
 he good spin right letters this week actually I did get a really a really fun one some guy
 said he's both a loyal customer and fan of spin right and grc since 1997 wow when you
 start making it 95 96 oh it's 19 years old oh it's older than that wow oh yeah yeah anyway
 so he says I love this one he says I do volunteer work for the Alberta diabetes foundation donors
 have provided systems to the ADF for a number of years now every time one of these systems
 will not boot and it appears that the hard drive has crashed I run spin right oh interesting
 there's a good test isn't that cool so so like people are bringing dead computers in you
 know donating them because they're computer so so so this guy goes on he says the number
 of times I've been able to call up a donor and ask them if they would like to have the
 data off the drive oh my gosh is in is incredible he said and this happens after the system
 has been in some shop that declared it DOA when they ask me how they can thank me I always
 just say thanks Steve Gibson and grc by purchasing spin right he said I have no way of knowing
 if this translates into any sales for you but I will bet the grc is who they think of
 the next time they get OS not found isn't that a nice that is really a nice story I was really
 cool so so you know the person machine dies they go oh well I'll just you know give it
 away to the diabetes foundation and then a couple days later the the guy calls up just
 hey by the way your computer was dead but there's all this data here would you like it
 that's great I love it well that's a spin right is everybody's favorite my favorite certainly
 disc maintenance and recovery utility and that's also grc.com and by the way Steve has
 a lot of free security programs it's worth browsing people often start with shields up
 which is a good way to test your network when you install a new router or firewall but don't
 stop there there's all sorts of free software de-combobulator unplug and pray and all sorts
 of very useful tools it's all at grc.com when's that new menuing system going in there I've
 got a little more work to do here before I get back to that but that's top of my list
 and I did want to mention that that at the bottom of the security now page is a form
 that people can use to send questions and comments and notes and things so grc.com/security
 now will take you to the top of the page scroll all the way down I'm gonna have to rearrange
 this whole security now area because we're growing like topsy we've got 65 episodes now
 but all the way down at the bottom is a form that anyone can use to send a questions and
 stuff directly to me and I really appreciate knowing what people are thinking and what
 they want to hear about good and next week I know what you want to hear about vista security
 that'll be a top topic I know with everybody listening and we will see you here next Thursday
 for another gripping edition of security now see you later Steve, thanks Leo.
