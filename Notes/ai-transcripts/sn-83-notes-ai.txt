 NetCasts you love from people you trust, this is twist bandwidth for security now is provided
 by AOL radio at AOL.com/podcasting this is security now with Steve Gibson
 episode 83 from March 15th 2007 list is UAC security now is brought to you by
 Astarro makers of the Astarro security gateway on the web at www.ASTARO.com
 and by nerds on site looking to grow your IT service business find out how nerds
 on site can help visit I want to be a nerd dot com time for security now our
 favorite security podcast well frankly my only security podcast but it's still
 my favorite and and my favorite security guru is here and that's for sure and
 that's mr. Steve Gibson from grc.com hi Steve Haley a great to be back with you we
 are we are of course gonna talk about something new in a moment the you actually
 am very excited about this the user access control the UAC feature in Vista
 and whether it really does protect you but before we get to that do you have
 anything from previous episodes you like to believe believe it or not we've yes
 we've basically we've basically snuck in an entire show on on maintaining full
 radio silence on Windows Wi-Fi well it started when we were talking about this
 free public Wi-Fi that pops up on Windows from time to time and what it was and
 how and how now Microsoft has offered a fix but never told anybody about it and
 you have to explicitly download it that's what we talked about last weekend if you
 didn't hear last week's episode you should absolutely download that update
 right so that was our second mention then the week before episode 81 we had we
 talked about we we actually showed the dialogues required to to turn off the
 functionality which is sort of this promiscuous connect to anything that I
 hear and also this this idea of broadcasting the the names of any networks
 you had connected to before which by default Windows tries to do right turns
 out that it's it's trying to do that still even after you've got the update
 because Microsoft added a checkbox to one of the configuration dialogues which is
 checked by default and you have to go turn it off so here in our fourth
 serialized how to get Wi-Fi just to shut up we have additional instructions
 people can if they go to the show notes for this episode 83 I've got a link back
 to the new and enhanced instructions for that are over now on episode 81's notes
 so episode 81 show notes are enhanced with this additional information and this
 episode links back to those so this is if you install the patch that Microsoft
 offered in November to fix wireless zero config it there's still it's still
 promiscuous unless you uncheck this box yes it is it there is a box which is
 which enables it to connect to networks which are not broadcasting and so if the
 networks are not broadcasting then your computer does
 I mean it's just like this is this ad hoc only or is it infrastructure networks
 as well it's both oh wow and and so anyway the the idea is you know and in fact I
 realize okay I started using that the term maintaining full radio silence yeah
 that's a good way to talk about it yeah as the you know the famous jargon and you
 know I mean that's what we want we want to be able to carry a laptop around if
 we forget to disable our Wi our Wi-Fi we don't want it sending out stuff of any
 sort we want full radio silence and so it turns out that following the
 instructions that are now on the show notes for 81 with the update which we
 talked about in 82 which we're all pulling together now in 83 when we first
 opened the topic in 80 we basically we basically snuck in a whole a whole
 security now episode on maintaining full radio silence just take those chunks and
 edit them together we have episode 84 are ready to go and then the other news
 is we had a second Tuesday of the month with no major Windows security updates
 Wow now that doesn't mean there were no major Windows security flaws we've
 learned and often Microsoft will just say well patches it ready or we're and
 we're not gonna elect to ship it out as I remember I saw that in fact there were
 several critical flaws in XP at least that Microsoft wasn't ready to patch yet
 so those flaws are still there presumably we patched next Tuesday but I don't
 think anybody said there any flaws in Vista and that's that's actually very
 encouraging news well and I don't think they'll be patched next Tuesday because
 I mean I mean oh I you met next next patch Tuesday right right right yeah
 Microsoft's doing it the second Tuesday of every month now unless there's
 something really serious going on and sometimes they'll they'll do a quick
 patch and of course several times I guess it was last year we saw them do
 that where they would catch up they said okay you know this will not wait for our
 standard monthly cycle we've got to get this done now well I'm I have to say
 and we're gonna talk about it today a little bit about Windows Vista security
 but I am encouraged you know Vista's been out now officially for more than a
 month almost a couple of months and I haven't seen any major exploits there
 been of course people have been attacking the Windows authentication but
 you know that's I don't care about that so much well in fact I think it was on
 one of your other podcast you were talking about where it might have been
 dignity where anyway so one of these podcasts I heard mentioned that there
 was now a tool that would generate valid keys for installing Vista and that it
 was possible that you know somebody else could come along with an a correct key
 right which Microsoft would say oh I'm afraid that's already been used you can't
 use that yeah that actually that I'll to update you on that that we were talking
 about on Windows weekly you and Paul turns out that was a scam a bogus it was
 phony and in the people who claim to have actual keys generated by this thing
 were were either lying and the guy who wrote it admitted it he said you know
 what 25 characters mix of alpha and numeric too big for any key brute force
 keycracker to solve so I was I lied to you however that doesn't mean that the
 hacks don't continue there's now a BIOS hack to change the to disable
 authentication so the hackers go on trying to crack into Windows Vista and
 everything I've heard about this latest one is that it does in fact work and it
 doesn't have that really you know somebody pointed out that this this key
 cracker if it had worked wouldn't be stealing from Microsoft it'd be stealing
 from other users because right you'd be coming up with a serial number that
 these other users might in fact legitimately have right yeah anyway that's
 that's where the hacking seems to be going on but but so far I haven't heard I
 don't have you of any exploits against Vista which is very encouraging well okay
 yes it's encouraging but it's also predictable for example you know we know
 that so many problems we had with Windows 2000 well certainly 95 98 Windows
 2000 I don't even want to talk about ME and and even XP were due to the fact
 that Microsoft just seems so slow about getting a clue about how to make a
 Windows system safe on the net all you have to do is have a firewall and as we
 know XP had it but it was disabled by default finally with service pack 2 they
 turned it on it's like it's funny I mean I'm seeing this pattern and I'm
 recognizing though what the pattern means the pattern is a means for sort of
 slowly but surely creeping forward with good security hello and well yes and
 this actually feeds directly into today's topic because I spent a lot of time
 researching something that I promised that we would talk about because I knew
 there was a lot there and that's this UA the UAC the user account control and
 because it's it's more than just the annoying dialogue that pops up there's a
 ton of of stuff going on back there and when I look at what Microsoft had to do
 to implement the solutions they have I mean I can understand why Vista took so
 long even though they threw out all the other goodies that they were promising to
 have in so-called Longhorn which was the you know the backroom code name for a
 long time there's there's really a lot there but for example Vista of course
 maintains XP service pack 2's default enabling of the firewall well that means
 that you don't have this problem of open ports that we've always had until
 well a router would be in front that would be a solution but obviously lots of
 people you know several years ago during the all of the worms on the net they
 didn't yet have home routers and and in fact I don't know at the time whether we
 were yet promoting the idea of a router as an affirmative hardware security
 measure I think still then we were talking about software firewall so you
 know certainly people who added software firewalls to their system or made sure
 XP's disabled by default firewall was enabled they were much more secure well
 finally we got that built in with service pack 2 and essentially that sort of
 whole set of problems is resolved now they're just that's just not gonna be a
 problem but what's interesting to me is that this is sort of the trend that we
 see with Microsoft where new better technology is put in but it's not
 enabled initially be sort of because they want to warn everyone right this is
 coming right they don't want to break everything but they do want to implement
 it so they give you a little yes heads up and a perfect example we've talked of
 course extensively about hardware depth data execution prevention that I'm so
 bullish about which now exists you know both in XP and with being given a lot
 more attention in in Vista what what I've seen as I've looked at it more is for
 example one of a very popular image viewing program called Irfan view right
 it turns out it won't run with depth turned on it's because it uses an XC
 packer an executable compression program called as pack aspack and the
 this it makes sense that it wouldn't because naturally a an executable
 compressor has got to decompress the executable so it allocates a bunch of
 data memory into which it decompresses the compressed executable and then it
 runs it well it's running a data allocation which is exactly what depth
 is designed to stop on the other hand UPX which is a the sort of the actually
 the leading and most popular XC compressor it's depth compatible because
 those guys realized hey when we allocate this memory we should mark the pages as
 executable in which case DEP has no problem with it so that's a great
 example of how a program might stumble over DEP but how it's also possible to
 do the same thing in a DEP friendly fashion now well isn't a hacker just
 mark his pages executable and avoid the problem himself well because he's got
 to be running in order to mark them so you can't run out of the car you can't
 run the code until he can run the code exactly exactly so so it's so it's the
 perfect example and we in fact we see this a lot for example that that you know
 when when Vista pops up the user account control screen the whole screen
 darkens and you get this highlighted dialogue that you have to say you know
 continue or cancel on in order to to allow this permission or not well it's
 been noted that you know malware could fake that screen in order to get users
 to type in administrative credentials and so from that standpoint it it sort of
 represents an Achilles heel of user account control because with user
 account control you're constantly if you're not running as an admin user you're
 constantly having to type in your admin credentials to prove that you know you
 have admin rights that are just you're not flexing those muscles right now which
 raises the exposure of those credentials but but then the point that
 they the counterpointed that is well yes but malware has to be running in your
 system in order to allow it to spoof user account control and what user
 account control prevents is the is the inadvertent installation of malware in
 the first place hey before we get too far into the discussion of user account
 control because I'm very interested in this should we pause for a station break
 sure and that we'll get back to it in just a second but I do want to mention
 our sponsors as we are talking about security a star owe security gateways
 the version 7 has come out and man what a major update I mean a lot of neat new
 features you're gonna take a look at of course you know the star of security
 gateway is a device that runs software that gives you a complete solution soup
 to nuts for security I mean everything from VPN to hacking intrusion
 detection you get email security antivirus anti spyware you get web
 filtering you get spam protection all of that in an easy to use device and all
 of course the network protection stuff that you'd expect but now with version
 seven there's some new features a centralized email encryption strategy
 which means you get email encryption and decryption at the device instead of at
 the desktop so your users is completely transparent for them a great way to
 implement SMIMER open PGP standards it now has SSL on VPN yay scalable via
 clustering so you can get as many as 10 a star a security gateways working
 together to really give you and without load balancing I mean to really give you
 some some powerful growth capabilities and this is the thing for home users that
 I'm very excited about you know in the past you've always offered the star
 gateway security gateway software so you could put it on your own beige box
 machine it's an open source distribution but now and in the past what they've
 done is they've charged you 79 euros and you'd have a subscription to all the
 other features the web filtering the spam the updates for the antivirus and
 this anti spyware well they've they've waived that subscription fee if you're
 a 10 users or 10 IP addresses and up to a thousand concurrent connection so it's
 for home users it's now completely free for all of the goodies a starow can offer
 this is really a great deal if you want to know more about a starow visit their
 website a s t a r o dot com a s t a r o dot com or call eight seven seven the
 number four a starow and they'll schedule a free trial of a starow
 security gateway in your business we thank a starow for their support of
 security now so you know some people complain sometimes about that user account
 control screen the fact that it it's a separate screen for instance I notice
 some programs don't work I use a program called synergy that allows me to share
 my mouse and keyboard over the network and it's befuddled by that screen I guess
 that's also to defeat some hacking yes in fact it's it's much more going on
 there than meets the eye let me finish with this with the sort of the concept
 that I was that I was oh sorry I mean it around you no no no it's fine erfin
 erfin of erfin view fame is now under tremendous pressure yes to get
 erfin view to be compatible with depth so even though it's disabled by default
 some early adopters like all the people we're preaching to are turning depth on
 they're discovering erfin views incompatible they're sending him support
 email saying hey this doesn't work so he could fix easily I'm sure it yes and
 and it's funny because I saw someone forwarded me his response which and I'm
 not sure what is native languages but it was pretty clear it's not English and he
 was like what's what's going on all of a sudden everyone's complaining about this
 and I'm thinking well can you say security now and and the importance of
 turning on hardware depth so so so so this is an exactly analogous thing to
 certainly what happened back in the early days of software firewalls early
 adopters who were security conscious turn this on and they were the people who
 were aware enough to understand sort of you know the the the UI complexity and
 sort of the downside of being an early adopter they put pressure on anything
 that was incompatible to get it fixed so essentially the way was paved for
 Microsoft and to come along later and do a firewall built into windows that would
 just be able to be turned on so similarly here Microsoft has depth and thanks to
 us bringing it to attention and of course Vista with Vista's increase
 security there is now pressure on developers of applications which are not
 depth-friendly to fix that so what I can absolutely foresee is that some point
 in the future depth will be enabled by default but it won't be until all of the
 early adopters have put pressure on applications and sort of moved in
 compatibility from more of the well yeah that's another problem so it's not
 worth turning depth on they've we've essentially moved it to where depth
 incompatible or unfriendly programs are enough in the minority that it's sort of
 more their fault for being un-depth friendly rather than than expected so
 so and and and we'll as we talk here about user account control that there's
 all kinds of aspects of what Microsoft has done in Vista which as I have
 explored it I've come to the conclusion that you know slow as Microsoft is you
 know glacial in fact in moving it's very clear to me with Vista that they they
 really got it I mean they that light finally lit up and said security is the
 big deal we have got to resolve this and you know I mean this was essentially
 Jim Alchen's final gift to Microsoft he was there for 17 years and he resigned
 the moment Vista went out the door he said I am done because he was he was the
 head of this project with a with a long deep career in networking and
 understanding this stuff and you know and and what what we end up with is he's
 essentially a system which throughout the system it's putting pressure on
 developers it's doing it gently just as the the existence of depth does sort of
 in the background but there is pressure nonetheless a perfect example is what
 you were just saying about how people are are upset or complaining about this
 UAC the user account control permission dialogue popping up so much it turns out
 that you can it application developer can completely control that so that it
 isn't popping up when it's not necessary but my default unless you mark your
 application as you see aware then Microsoft falls back to the default
 behavior of of like essentially popping it up too much because your application
 hasn't provided the granularity which is available in Windows a perfect example
 is my little secureable app that I wrote a couple months ago I made it Vista
 compatible by specifically appending what's called an application manifest to the
 executable to declare that this thing needs administrative privileges because
 as we'll remember I am installing explicitly briefly I'm installing a
 a kernel driver in order to access the chip sets hardware directly in order to
 to get underneath any disabling that the BIOS or Windows may have done I want to
 actually see what the hardware is telling me the only way to do that is from ring
 zero in the kernel so secureable announces right up front hey I'm gonna
 need admin privileges so anyone attempting to run secureable in Vista
 in is immediately presented with this you AC dialog well it would be possible and
 Microsoft provides complete documentation for for making that more granular so
 that for example you could run secureable and if there were more to it I mean
 basically you run secureable and it simply shows you the results so there
 was no UI process to go through which is why I have that dialogue the user
 account control dialogue presented right up front but for example it's very
 possible for a more complex application not to show you that dialogue until you
 actually do something that will at that you know in that user interface event
 will will need those kind of privileges a perfect example is setting the clock
 if you look under Vista at the just the standard old clock setting dialogue the
 button that you have to push to change the time has a little shield on it that
 shield over time will come to be associated in users minds with oh this is
 user account control so Microsoft has designed an icon which can be attached
 to buttons which Apple just to sort of show users if you push this we're gonna
 ask you and so it creates a little bit of sort of interactivity I mean even
 pre-pushing interactivity because the user can can adopt the expectation that
 they're gonna be asked for credentials that they're not logged in as an admin
 user so so the idea is that all of these things they put pressure on the
 developers you know your application can be more friendly if you do the
 following things well in the process it is substantially more secure also and
 so what will happen is this will did this behavior will end up over time
 pervading applications which become Vista aware and so this whole notion of
 needing admin privileges will be diminished the other thing is that because
 now even people running as admin users are being prompted to confirm again the
 application experience is is is the motivation that developers have to
 minimize their use of admin privileges it turns out Microsoft's analysis of
 many applications showed them that most apps really don't even need admin
 privileges it's just they were sort of they were in expertly or I should say
 casually written so that well you know what the heck I'm running as an admin
 but we know most users run as an admin so will we won't pay much attention to
 that well thanks to Vista not even running admins as admins which I'll
 talk about in a second it turns out that all applications which were sort of
 assuming admin privilege even when they didn't need it they're now popping up
 these dialogues which can be easily prevented just by having the developer
 pay more attention to whether admin privileges are really necessary or not
 and I mean just that simple this little bit of pressure is going to end up
 changing the experience it's gonna it's gonna make applications more friendly
 under Vista by by essentially never showing this user account control
 dialog because there was a little pressure on the app on the application
 writers to do the right thing so by default the application if the
 application writer doesn't do anything opts for the highest level of security
 just assumes that you have no access to do anything well yes and and Microsoft
 recognizes that there are apps old apps for example that are no longer being
 maintained companies have gone out of business you know you still want to be
 able to run those securely so if the application doesn't identify itself as
 being Vista aware then Microsoft defaults to the behavior we were seeing from
 most existing applications at Vista launch time which is you know this is a
 lot in your face it's not too bad I have to say it isn't too bad I think though
 that really it does respond to a problem that I've seen in both XP and Windows
 2000 of applications not running at all if you're not an admin yes and in fact
 that was what secureable was doing when I was first running secureable it was
 failing silently and I thought wait a minute you know that's not good so it
 wasn't it didn't have admin privileges and rather than asking for them I was I
 was performing some calls what Microsoft has done is a little bit of a problem
 because they are there they're silently failing some low-level calls with
 outlet in the application know that this thing it tried to do didn't work I guess
 they're trying to be a little bit tricky but you know or or or or clever and in
 order to to prevent malware from knowing that something it wanted to do
 hasn't happened there there's a there are many layers to this they've got
 something called ui pi the user interface privilege isolation which is
 another new thing in Vista we've never had it before it's again really a long
 time in coming but we'll do a lot to enhance desktop security the idea is
 that they've added a new abstraction for applications called integrity levels you
 can have low medium high or system integrity and many things to go on in
 terms of the system communication depend upon the level of integrity for
 example a lower integrity process cannot validate a window handle which is
 something that goes on in the API of a process with higher integrity you cannot
 send it a message or post a message to a process with on with a higher
 integrity level there are other things that hackers often do known as attaching
 a thread or a journal hook to an application and injecting DLLs is a
 common means for for sticking a D one of your own DLLs into a privileged
 application and getting it to run there all these things were fundamental I
 mean long-standing fundamentals serious security problems and windows so
 Microsoft is sort of inching forward they they couldn't turn that stuff off
 because it would break too many things so they said okay let's create a new
 abstraction this notion of how much we trust applications and so for example
 Internet Explorer runs at the lowest level of integrity as does email
 applications because they're communicating and they're there more
 potential vectors were trouble so those programs have absolutely no need to be
 reaching out and touching other applications on the desktop but by default
 Windows was designed for example a macro recorder could could attach to another
 process and send a keystrokes that's how macro recorders and macro playback
 operates is you're able to sort of send messages to an app to a program as if
 you were the user typing things or or clicking the mouse well malware is able
 to do that also in order to to cause you know obviously malicious things to
 happen so this long-standing behavior again Microsoft is slowly turning down
 the you know tightening the screws on this saying wait a minute for for things
 that are we don't trust as much we're gonna limit their ability to access other
 programs well now this will break some things Microsoft is is unable as we've
 seen for example with the kernel patch protection they're unable to simply
 shut down all kernel modification in 32-bit Windows as they have for 64 so
 they're saying look we're gonna be really resistant to this kind of behavior and
 and sort of try to moderate how much they push back but what's very clear as
 you look at what Microsoft has done throughout Windows Vista is there is
 some finally some real pushback from the OS onto applications saying look it's
 time for us all to clean up our act it's time for us to start behaving
 ourselves and you can you can read the handwriting on the wall that this is
 going to be increasingly enforced over time until eventually Leo I can say I
 can foresee that the time when Windows ends up being the most secure operating
 system around what I'm really hearing you say it actually explains a lot but
 the people like Chris Parello who have decided to go back there they don't want
 to use Vista they're going back to XP because so much stuff doesn't work what
 they're really running up against is what we've always said all along it's a
 trade-off security for convenience and in security for compatibility and in a
 way it's encouraging to me that Vista is not compatible with some of these
 applications it can't be if it wants to be secure well yes and in fact we also
 hear I mean I did a lot of research I I've heard in fact even even our friend
 Joanna Rutuska who are who created the blue pill system she's poked around at
 UAC some and she commented that initially that well first of all that is
 sure what one of her main system she's using all the time is Vista she's moved
 over to it and she was seeing that she was getting the UAC pop-up a lot
 initially and that it quieted down it stopped being a problem and so I think
 it's it's clear that it's also a function of what kind of user you are
 certainly Chris is a power user he's installing things all the time he's
 experimenting with stuff he's you know he's a different profile than your
 typical you know buy a new Dell laptop at you know Circuit City and
 basically take it home plug it in and don't do anything with it because it's
 got all the stuff in it already that you need well and that's what I've been
 saying if you're getting a new computer and you don't have legacy hardware and
 software absolutely go with Vista and if you're not if you're upgrading you
 might want to wait just because of these compatibility issues well again I thought
 you know for myself I'm happy at XP and I also saw where you were happy in
 2000 until about a month ago in fact you still run 2000 don't you I in fact I'm
 sitting in front of 2000 I was a little annoyed that Microsoft chose not to
 update the time zone change during our recent daylight savings time shift you
 know the Windows 2000 is still under their critical care whatever the heck
 they call it you know where you know major security things get fixed but non
 important things don't get fixed which they could have easily done but I think
 it's you know some pressure from Microsoft to say okay come on here man
 they're not telling me to move forward but they're telling you know the
 industry it's time to start moving away from Windows 2000 yeah although there's
 no technical reason I mean the all of that all that daylight savings time
 update is is simply changing a setting for when summer time begins there's no
 there's no need to vet that or test it it's just push it out yes so it's very
 blatantly if you ask me commercial pressure to upgrade yeah I know technical
 technical reason I think that's clearly what's going on but again just just to
 make sure I made myself clear I could see Chris backing away from Vista and
 essentially allowing other people to get the arrows in their backs and like
 essentially solve these problems it makes sense to wait for applications to
 mature for the Vista environment I mean they're you know as I really came to
 understand as I looked at what was going on here I realized you know these are
 deep changes when we talked about this the incompatibility you experience with
 like remote control of the secure desktop it is explicitly the case that
 that the secure desktop even though it sort of just looks like the desktop got
 dim and a dialogue was was allowed to run at you know sort of like in the
 foreground what's actually happening is the that desktop bitmap is copied and
 the desktop is switched to a secure environment where nothing but system
 application nothing but system code is able to have any contact with that
 desktop so application code which is normally what you have running for
 example keystroke macro recorders and playback and so forth that are using
 Windows hooks in order to control applications remotely and certainly you
 know keyboard and mouse remoting those things lose they have they have no
 connection to this secure desktop and the reason Microsoft did this is they
 wanted to prevent obviously malware from clicking continue before the user is
 able to click cancel if this has been presented by malware trying to install
 itself right so so you know it it it really is a substantial change now Joe
 Anna in examining this use this user account control stuff she spotted
 something which really annoyed her which was in order for Microsoft not to break
 installers they've done this bizarre stuff Leo literally if you run any
 program that contains the word install or set up or update in the file name
 Vista looks at the file name the executable file name and if it says if it
 has install or setup or update or many other things like specific vendors
 or company names product names keywords in the in the executable specific
 strings in the in the environment any of these things will trigger Vista to
 decide you're running an installer which should have admin privileges now it's
 funny because I don't expect a hacker to put the word setup update install into
 their software or even name it such do you well again I mean it's a perfect door
 for a Trojan to you know basically trick somebody into running a truck make it
 look like a standard installer of course yeah exactly and and essentially for
 anything that looks like an installer Vista completely drops its guard and
 Joanna's complaint was anything that with those words in the name for example
 can install drivers in the kernel and so it's like well okay but that's what a
 setup program may need to do it may need to legitimately install drivers in the
 kernel and so I guess the you know Microsoft's response again is well wait
 a minute we asked you if you wanted to run this program so it's we've prevented
 it from happening behind your back and that's the whole point is you know we're
 gonna prompt you to make sure this is what you want to do and again it's it's
 Microsoft fighting the you know the the the need to not break old things while
 waiting for them to catch up for example once all the installers and
 installer systems around have been caught up Microsoft can can quietly
 back off on this sort of flaky heuristic approach to solving the problems of the
 past and and again putting more pressure on these things to update in order for
 those programs to identify themselves as installers that explicitly need admin
 admin privileges in order to run right right so it's it I mean it's essentially
 I'm I'm very impressed with what Microsoft has done even you know we've
 also commented how even users who do run this to as an admin you know you're
 typical I don't need no stinking you know limited accounts guys and that's the
 default by the way it's it encourages you to make a user account but doesn't
 require it and actually the way it works by default Leo is the first account you
 create is one of these you know sort of limited admin accounts successive accounts
 are right users right right right yeah by by if you only and most people just
 create one account though that's my point and that that account will be an
 admin account yes it will now what's interesting though is that log on two
 separate tokens two separate privileged tokens are actually created by the
 operating system it creates a privileged user it also creates what they call a
 filtered standard user and that's what everything you do runs under it is so
 you really aren't running as an admin if even if you're running as an admin yes
 that that is what's so cool and that's it's one of the things that I didn't
 understand is that you you are you absolutely are not running with admin
 privileges even when you log on as an administrator you get this this filtered
 limited standard user token and that's the that's the privilege under which
 explorer XC not not Internet Explorer XC the main desktop shell which is the
 the parent process for everything else you do that is running as a standard
 user and it's it's called a filtered token because what happens is Windows
 is watching for things asking this token for for heightened privileges and so
 the the more privileged admin token the real admin token does still exist and
 that's what Windows will switch to if you satisfy it by saying yes I want to
 proceed with installing you know whatever it is you're doing but by default even
 an admin user under Vista is running as a standard user do you know of any
 attempts to hack you AC to get around in a moment it sounds like UAC provides a
 very good barrier but of course with any barrier it might be possible to just
 ignore it to get around it well and certainly that is the attack surface that
 we can we can imagine hackers will be going after they're not gonna go straight
 in they're gonna have to go around exactly one of the things that I have
 seen as I'm as I've looked at at what Microsoft has done is that all the
 things that all of us have known have like I have always been wrong with Windows
 they have fixed this notion of inter the the two easy inter application
 communications well they've created this integrity level concept to like to
 mitigate that threat and and to prevent DLL injection while while still not
 breaking it completely they've made it less accessible and you know certainly
 data execution prevention and the address space layout randomization ASLR
 to to make things load in unknown uncertain locations to prevent hackers
 from being able to jump to code at known fixed locations in the system I mean
 basically they've they've sat back and they've looked at everything wrong and
 with Windows Vista they said okay we can't just lock down on this because things
 will break but we're going to make it very clear that we are in the process of
 locking down on these things which is why I'm so encouraged I mean I you know
 I'm as you know I'm I've been very rough on Microsoft historically about their
 lack of care and lack of concern as you know pulling my hair out with raw sockets
 and and so for so long they just kept running with no firewall enabled and and
 active exploitable services open ports exposed to the internet you know those
 things are fixed and this is what what Vista represents is a major
 psychological mindset change about where Windows is going I mean it is I'm not
 surprised that Chris Brillo has backed off from it because it's so new and they
 mean what he's feeling is he's feeling that pressure I expect that three or four
 years from now it'll be a much will but when I'm ready to move to it it'll be a
 much better experience because that pressure will have have will a rippled
 backwards through the application community and and application providers
 wanting their stuff just to work seamlessly they will have fixed things to
 be Vista compatible and and in the meantime I'm happy with XP now let me
 ask a question because a couple of podcasts ago you were worried about
 Vista's virgin stack that completely rewritten stack that at least in beta
 was making some mistakes that had been fixed in earlier versions of Windows
 any evidence that the the stack is providing a weakness well it's not
 providing a static weakness by which I mean because of the firewall in front of
 it it's there's no access to it there is still the problem that once you've got
 a connection open there could be some packet level connectivity problems but
 we haven't heard of anything yet I wouldn't be surprised if we end up with
 some some funky way that a malicious server could send you bad packets the
 problem is they couldn't be unsolicited they have to be solicited and you know
 that so that's a much lower attack surface than what we saw before for
 example with Unix with no firewall running by default and just all these
 services running and and and you know in the very early days of of the Unix stack
 where all these exploits and and mistakes were first being made so you
 know Microsoft even though they've got this unproven stack which which worries
 me it's much less easy to get access to it from the outside yeah well I have to
 say I'm I'm excited and I'm you know I've been very happy running Vista both
 in emulation on my Mac and on on at least one of my PCs I can't run it on
 another one because Adobe audition does not work with Vista yeah it doesn't seem
 to have any timeline when it will somebody told me that well and and you
 know the totally makes sense too because as we know Vista completely revamps the
 whole audio subsystem in order to add DRM I'm sure it's a it's a major thing to
 rewrite and and it's based on old code cool at it pro so I have a feeling it
 may be that in fact some have indicated that perhaps Adobe won't even do an
 audition for Vista but just start a whole new application like sound booth from
 scratch we do want to thank right now our great friends at nerds on site who
 are celebrating I'm sad to say their last episode with security now if you are
 a nerd they need nerds to serve as their customers visit I want to be a nerd
 dot-com nerds on site are looking for nerds with all competencies competencies
 and the skills for PC and Mac experts to specialties like Cisco Cisco not
 sis not Cisco Cisco Cisco's a movie reviewer and Oracle actually I think
 it combines Cisco and Oracle to make one one thing you name it they need it
 fixing technicians web designers programmers project managers even you
 don't have to you could be a sales nerd a trainer as a security expert like
 Steve antivirus gurus the list goes on they especially love nerds who like to
 troubleshoot tear apart and rebuild their own systems in their spare time nerds
 are independent contractors you're in business for yourself but not buy
 yourself and that's what's so cool about nerds on site you could focus on your
 passion and not the burdens of running a business all over the world seven
 countries 256 different competencies in that University of University of
 Nerdology visit I want to be a nerd dot-com and register for a nerds only
 meeting in your area today great people we really are glad that they stopped
 off and spent some time with us on security now wish them all the best in
 the future I want to be a nerd dot com boy this is this is you know I have a
 feeling Microsoft is one of we're gonna want to publish this podcast on their
 website you go to grc.com Microsoft you get a transcript you can also everybody
 can do that 16 kilobits version for the bandwidth impaired I know Bill Gates
 doesn't yet is have broadband so maybe you want to go to grc.com that's also
 where Steve stores all his great security programs like the new
 secureable de-combobulator unplug and pray and of course shields up is if you
 cross 50 million users yet no we're approaching that's gonna be that's gonna
 be a big of a party yeah grc.com and of course that's where
 Spinwright lives to everybody's favorite my favorite this recovery and maintenance
 utility if you've got a hard drive you need Spinwright at grc.com next week
 it's a question and answer time yep we'll we'll do a dozen of our listeners
 questions and answers and to answer the question that they ask how to send
 that you go to grc.com/securitynow that brings up our main and growing
 security now page scroll all the way to the bottom and there's a web form just
 fill it out you can put a name and and tell us where about your calling from
 send your you know click the send button to post it to me I'll receive it and we'll
 we'll get to it next week thank you Steve have a great safe secure week and we'll
 see you next time on security now
