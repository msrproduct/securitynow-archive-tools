 security now is Steve Gibson episode 63 for October 26th 2006 mojo pack
 security now is brought to you by a starrow makers of the starrow security
 gateway on the web at www dot a s t a r o dot com and by Dell for this week's
 specials visit Twitt dot TV slash Dell it's time to say hello to Steve Gibson
 and another great security now hello Steve how are you a Leo great to be back
 fall has hit I don't know about Irvine but Petaluma the leaves are starting to
 drop off the trees it's really got a great fall feeling to it well you guys
 get a lot of rain up in northern California to we did we got some rain
 yeah so but it it's it's been a little nippy actually so I think that that's why
 warm it during the days in the 70s but at night getting a little chilly I
 don't know why I'm giving you the weather forecast I don't know why we're
 giving a hundred thousand listeners the weather that's yeah that's one thing to
 give you the weather forecast maybe we should talk about security what's up
 today well today we're going to talk about mojo pack mojo pack last week I
 thought we were going to talk about mojo pack and you three and something
 called mocha five but in the interim I've learned a lot about mojo pack I did
 finally get a hold of the mojo pack people at the actually actually the
 parent company is a company called ring cube I had a conference call with the
 the CTO the their chief technology officer to get all of my you know deep
 techie questions answered the the problem I had was that their website is is all
 about features and benefits you know it's very sales and marketing but you know
 as I was always the case I wanted to understand what they were actually doing
 what was going on you know underneath what was the technology what is this
 virtual machine technology you know or and how they'd implemented it into what
 level because what that essentially everything that it that that it can do
 flows from the way it does what it does of course yeah I mean wait wait I think
 everybody's seen the hype or at least a lot of people have and kind of take it
 on face value and of course that's why we're counting on you to tell us what's
 really going on and if it really does what it says it does we've heard some
 problems - I've gotten some emails from companies who say you know the light our
 licenses didn't work once it was installed on mojo pack things like that so
 well I can address that because now I understand from the from be got by
 understanding that the the underlying technology I understand why they've had
 those problems and so as a result and because you three and mocha five and a
 couple other portable app solutions are so different I we're just gonna talk
 about mojo pack today this will be the mojo pack episode and then I big but the
 other things are also neat in it in a different way and so we'll talk about
 those in future episodes of security now in fact I think you know like near term
 future so good episodes well this kind of follows on what we just did finished
 which is our virtual virtualization series so this is kind of another kind
 it's not really virtualization but it's something else something related well
 yes so so here's the story mojo pack is a cool thing I've I've downloaded it
 I've been playing with it for a few days and it there there's a lot of good
 about it but but what it's doing is difficult to do essentially it's not
 virtual machine technology as we've been talking about it at all what it I mean
 it it I don't want to say that it's rootkit technology because that has a
 negative connotation but it's it's friendly rootkit technology interesting
 huh what they're actually doing is they are they're installing a dynamic driver
 so so jumping ahead a little bit you are a mojo pack user you've got this USB
 device and that can either be a hard disk drive or a solid state you know
 flash rom dongle you stick it in to an unsuspecting Windows XP machine that has
 never seen mojo pack before has nothing mojo-ish installed on it at the moment
 and so what happens is the the auto start dot any fires up if it's enabled on
 that Windows machine so that so on that Windows XP machine it's also important
 say that this won't work on Windows 2000 this is an XP only solution okay so so
 one issue is that you know power users may have disabled auto start and there
 or you know other systems may have it disabled for one reason other so and you
 may have to manually run the start dot XC program on your dongle or your drive
 if the hosting machine has auto start disabled no big deal but it's you know
 a little bit less automatic in any event when you when you run this start dot
 XC it essentially and it dynamically loads a kernel driver into the system
 which deeply hooks the Windows native API we've talked about those are words
 that scare me when you say that I know and and in fact I I don't I the other
 word I don't want to use up to describe mojo pack is Cluj because Cluj also
 has lots of negative yeah negative connotations but but frankly you know a
 personal firewall a third-party personal firewall is also a Cluj because you know
 it's doing something to Windows that Windows was never designed to have done
 to it and you know and that's why personal firewalls have caused problems
 for people they've they've you know conflicted with other applications things
 break blah blah blah you know it's it's it's doing something deeply to Windows
 in the kernel that Windows was never designed to accommodate well mojo pack
 is doing the same thing and so in that same sense it's a Cluj but it's a Cluj
 with benefits it's a Cluj with power it's a Cluj that you might want to have
 you know much like much like you want to have a personal firewall so what
 happens is when you install mojo pack there's no virtualization stuff going on
 basically it reaches deeply into Windows and and hooks the kernel many of the
 of the kernel level API see already I don't this is making me very nervous
 well and I'm gonna read you I mean I'm gonna flesh out this opinion which comes
 from the technology with some real-world examples of the consequences so so so it
 it makes these low-level hooks and this is the way you know you know before we
 go too far I don't think we've really described because have we described what
 it does from the user's point of view ah very good point we're talking about
 what it does from the technical point but but why would why are people so
 excited about this what does it do for the user okay so what what the
 experience I've had which is why I started off saying this is a really cool
 thing is I I downloaded the mojo pack I and the mojo pack Xe I installed it on
 a 512 K dongle then I installed my my favorite news reader gravity and I
 installed my favorite outlining tool which something called thought manager
 desktop which I because I'm I love outlining you know I work from an outline
 every time I'm here in front of the microphone with you Leo because I've
 you know going through the all the points I want to remember about what I'm
 talking so and then I I imported all of my working outlines I got online and I
 downloaded 3,000 news group messages from the GRC news server all in this this
 512 K dongle then I uninstalled I shut down mojo pack and ejected the dongle
 pulled it out went over to another different windows XP machine that had
 never seen any of this stuck it in the USB port mojo pack ran by itself started
 up brought me to a login dialogue where I had to give it my my password to log
 in then the normal desktop that I had been looking at on that Windows X meme
 on those Windows XP machine disappeared was replaced by a brand new Windows
 desktop that looked just like what I had when I removed the dongle from the
 first machine and there were in the you know standard Windows looking start
 button I mean it is the Windows start button and programs there was my news
 reader gravity and my outlining thought manager both running I mean able to
 run why I brought I brought him up there were all my postings and so what it
 creates basically it allows you through all of this work that these guys have
 done to to sort of have a portable windows install of your own that can run
 off of any USB 2.0 device so for example I mean a cell phone that's got an
 additional memory card installed or your iPod or you know anything that is USB
 2.0 you're able to install mojo pack and basically build yourself a your own
 portable Windows environment that is not just your data but also your
 applications that's impressive well and that's the big difference because you
 know certainly people have been able to you know synchronize their data and
 like move PowerPoint files or briefcase to that I mean that's no big deal
 exactly so so the real difference here is you're able to install applications
 well the way they've pulled this off and and it's important to note also these
 are any applications in a couple weeks we'll be talking about you three which is
 sort of like this but you three takes a very different approach of creating an
 environment where applications have to be aware that they're running from a
 solid-state device the the mojo pack guys have have have basically by by
 deeply hooking the windows kernel they have they're they're basically
 simulating a a standard Windows environment on a USB device Wow so that
 they so the applications are none the wiser now there are some caveats to that
 because since they're not performing full virtualization the applications may
 notice that they've been moved to different machine now now again this is
 something the kind of thing that can probably be and and in some cases
 definitely will be fixed in the future for example users immediately noticed
 that the retail version of office would when they moved it to a to a foreign
 machine they they'd installed office apps on their mojo pack USB device when
 they moved it to another machine it said okay you need to activate me so office
 deactivated because it's not that it had to different platform in a in a true
 virtual machine environment as we know the you know the app doesn't know can't
 know that it's on a different machine because the entire environment has been
 virtualized here mojo pack is is doing what it needs to to make the
 applications run however Mike the the CTO guy that I asked this question of
 said in the next release of mojo pack they will deal with making office
 function universally Wow Wow but now but but but this is sort of the this is
 sort of the the way I want to characterize this I want to characterize it
 carefully for people my sense is that it's a it's a quirky system because what
 these guys are trying to do is difficult in the same way that the very first
 personal firewalls were much more quirky than than they are now well I
 even think of things like desk you and application switchers where you're
 really trying to get into their hooks of the operating system and change how it
 behaves yes you're just really taking some big chances well and so let me
 give you some examples for example from their own knowledge base they cannot
 install on a system where there are multiple where you have a multi boot
 operating system that's booting from drives other than C you know that it is
 possible for example to to have a CD any partitions or drives and have the OS
 actually installed on D or E or a non C colon drive under windows mojo pack
 can't handle that for another another example is host machine screen saver and
 power management they say that some failures have been observed when the
 host machine screen saver or power management options become active under
 printer drivers problem oh no just wait Leo Colonel you know sometimes they're
 saying Colonel mode printer drivers will fail installation in the guest that is
 in the mojo pack guest this includes programs that install their own virtual
 printer driver such as Adobe Acrobat okay it doesn't work well but but it's
 important to know that acrobat reader does it's just the it's the it's the
 acrobat distiller you know acrobat pseudo printer that can't but then they
 say this limitation will be addressed in a future version it says that they have
 a pretty long list of limitations to be addressed in future versions well yes
 let me let me go a little bit further here just to sort of flesh out this
 notion that is under com plus application certain applications that
 require com plus may behave strangely or malfunction under the recycle bin on
 some PCs deleted folders may not appear in the guest after file slash folder
 deletion however there there may be items to empty in there my own
 experience I like to have auto arrange turned on on my desktop and it's just
 not sticky I've never I keep turning it on as I move mojo pack for machine to
 machine and it doesn't stay neither do the icon positions because I like to sort
 of organize where things are and it sort of forgets where they were previously
 under word and excel they say that excel docs containing a font symbol that was
 created on XP pro service pack to show the symbol as an unrecognizable value
 and opened on the guest plugged into host without ms excel installed they may
 they say you may see problems with ole when opening docs with office windows
 media player users are advised not to install windows media player 11 within
 mojo pack as it will lead to unpredictable behavior and recovery to the previous
 stable state may not be possible under reboots by third-party applications
 reboots by third-party applications may not always work the reboot is usually
 requested during the application install I mean and this goes on and on and on
 games for example one of the math cool things you can imagine would be like a
 world of warcraft addict wants to carry his whole world of warcraft environmental
 around with him so that he can go to a foreign machine plug in and just be up
 and running except that it says certain games such as world of warcraft exhibit
 offset mouse movement at the end of install in other words clicking on a
 control a windows control will not trigger the desired action the user
 should move the mouse around the control to find the amount of offset from the
 mouse's visible and actual position the mouse can I know I know I'm reading this
 going oh my goodness the mouse can then be moved to the offset location in order
 to activate the control note this behavior does not occur when the user
 plays the game oh something about the game is causing the mouse the mouse is
 visible location and it's it's it's effective location to be skewed and so
 they say well sort of you know hover over things and see when they light up to
 figure out where the mouse actually is so so I mean and there's less a lot of
 these things so so and and and so this is why I have to kind of characterize this
 as a cluge but I don't want to put people off of it because for most things I
 think it really works I mean I don't actually have a need to move you know my
 news reader and all of my news groups around and and to do this kind of thing
 but I'm I'm sure there are people who have this kind of need and it really does
 work now what happens is when you when you are looking at the mojo desktop
 there's a bar at the top the mojo bar that is unfortunately about the ugliest
 thing I have ever seen I right clicked on it and there was a little pop-up saying
 return to default skin so it's like oh great maybe I could like fix this well
 this is actually reminiscent of zone alarm remember that day glow orange oh
 yeah those own alarm guys use well I mean I love the firewall back in the
 beginning but I used to tease them all the time about how horrible you know the
 horrible colors they had chosen for the UI well the good news is that apparently
 this mojo bar their own toolbar is skinable and I'm sure people are already
 hard at work in replacing the default skin which is just got awful I mean it's
 just it just ruins the the look of the rest of your system but you know it does
 work and it allows you to instantly with a single click to switch back and forth
 between your mojo eyes desktop and the desktop on the host when you're looking
 from at the host view you can you can see the mojo drive and you're able to
 copy any things that you want to to it sort of from the host side it looks just
 like a regular drive they also provide a cool synchronization utility that
 allows you and offers to just sort of like move your whole documents and
 setting tree over so that all all of your settings and your your whole my
 documents group are are moved over so so that's very it makes very easy to to
 synchronize and and and to set things up over there one of the things you cannot
 do is and this is the one of the most often requested things that they are
 never going to address is you cannot simply move pre-installed applications
 from your host machine into the mojo environment and and this is deliberate
 on their part also it's very difficult to do as we know because it's it's very
 difficult to move and an already installed app to you know anywhere because
 apps can do so much to the system when they install themselves but these guys
 recognize that they have in in do in creating this notion of mobile applications
 they've really turned the license the software licensing model upside down I
 mean on its head because if you look at the yulas the end user license
 agreements in virtually anything you install it says this is for use on one
 single computer now I talked to them about this explicitly and they said well
 you know actually we looked at a lot of yulas many of them say on to you can do
 two installs because they want to be laptop friendly they want to allow
 people to install on their main workstation and also on a laptop I'm gonna
 give them the benefit of the doubt on that the the yulas I have seen tend to
 say only use this on one machine so inherently you're this is a multi machine
 install you are installing the application that the yula says you can only run in
 one location you're installing it on an inherently portable device you know my
 feeling is you make one installation of the app you you are carrying it around
 you're the only one using it I would say even though it might be outside the
 letter of what the yula was written to say the yula wasn't written with mojo in
 mind so you know I wouldn't consider that a big breach of the publisher's
 license however this is why the mojo pack guys want to be very clear that when
 you when you install mojo pack from the start basically you you you start off
 with it what looks like an empty windows system it uses windows profiles they
 basically it creates a mobile user profile on the mojo pack device and you
 end up looking at you know a virgin windows desktop with a start button and
 nothing in the programs group and you must then manually reinstall any things
 from scratch that you want to have on your mojo pack and be portable the the
 mojo pack guys feel that this this deals with the the upside-down nature of
 portable licensing in a good way because basically they're saying users are being
 given their responsibility of installing or reinstalling existing
 applications if they want them to be portable rather than for example mojo
 pack just cloning them somehow into this portable device which they're
 explicitly not willing to do so so you know that's sort of the gist of this
 thing it's a it's a small download it's only about a nine meg download it's not
 currently digitally signed which is a point I brought up to them and they said
 yes we know that we're gonna fix that because of course now my windows and
 certainly Internet Explorer is becoming increasingly reactionary to the idea of
 not having digitally you know took of users running non-signed things that
 they've just downloaded from the internet you get all kinds of unknown
 publishers and are you really sure you want to do this kinds of messages it it's
 it's it's a the the release price was basically half price 24 99 it is going up
 to 49 99 that is to say $50 in just three weeks I think that's a mistake on
 Thursday exactly three weeks from today Leo Thursday November 16th the the
 registered price of mojo pack doubles up to $50 I really I really think they
 should given that that they've still got so many little bits of debris to work
 out my advice would be what's the hurry you know extend this special offer time
 another couple months especially since they had a bunch of problems when they
 came out of the gate you know taking it out of beta I really think this is a
 much too narrow window I guess it's really only been about a one-month window
 before they jumped the price up as I understand it their venture finance so
 they shouldn't have cash flow problems and I really I mean I would encourage
 people to play with this the way the way it works without registration is you
 get 30 days of use or 200 boots and they doubled that number of boots recently
 because people were running dry well before their 30 days were up they only
 had a hundred boots before that is actually a hundred stick the mojo packs
 in a computer is what's called a boot and so you know I've already used up 15
 of mine just moving it around in a couple days you know playing with it so so if
 people think this might be something they're interested in in messing with
 you've got three weeks before the price doubles the other good news is you know
 I'm very sensitive to things impacting my system you know I I didn't like
 installing you know VMware on test machines or or like messing with with
 virtual PC and these other things because I mean these like these these
 quacked your machine mojo pack doesn't as far as I can see it makes zero change
 to the machine on which you download their XC and on and where you install
 mojo pack and and and that's all part of their philosophy when you when you
 shut down mojo pack and remove it from a machine their dynamic device driver
 unloads the machine that that that host where you were temper that you were
 temporarily visiting and basically using its its resources its network and
 processing and screen and other resources it ends up not knowing anything
 has happened and and that's the magic of their kernel level hooks the the apps
 running in mojo pack see a c drive but they the c drive is the actual mojo pack
 device remapped to see and and the the actual host c drive is not available it
 is inaccessible so there's no changes be made to the registry there's no debris
 left behind no browser settings no no trail of URLs you visited nothing
 changes on the host and so so from from us from a security standpoint that you
 know this is one of the main advantages that they were going for and this is
 unique among these other solutions we know for example their sandboxy and there
 are you know full robust VM solutions but any VM solution is inherently going
 to seriously sit on the machine you install it on so in that in that in that
 in that sense mojo pack is very lightweight it's I mean and I have to
 say I mean I like it I would encourage people not to be put off by you know
 their list of knowledge base yes we know we have these problems I mean I found
 some myself I right-clicking on network neighborhood which is now renamed my
 network places under XP nothing comes up I right click and do properties I can't
 get properties I thought okay well you know what's going on so I clicked the
 mojo bar at the top instantly switched back to the host right clicked on mine
 my I forgot what it's called now network neighborhood or or my network
 things and and the dioli network things is good I like that I recommend that for
 this day yeah and you know and and everything was as I remembered it back
 over to mojo and that just doesn't work yeah so I was like okay add that to the
 list so so the point is what they're doing is something windows was never
 designed to have done to it and and frankly if this is such a cool idea we
 it's as long as we sort of tolerate the the question of mobile licenses which is
 still a little bit up in the air in my opinion but the idea is so cool you can
 imagine that in some future version of Windows that you know this won't be
 something Windows fights it'll be something Microsoft acquires much as
 Microsoft finally added a personal firewall to XP you know several years
 after everybody else had had gotten bloodied on the battlefield developing
 the technology I could easily imagine that this kind of portable application
 stuff is so cool that it ends up ultimately you know generations from now
 appearing in Windows but it's available today I might just point out that the
 apples had this for about 10 years but okay thank you Lee actually it's not
 that's really not fair in fact they may even exist for Windows but Apple
 networking can be set up so that no matter where you are in the network when
 you log into your network it's your desktop your preferences your applications
 okay well now Windows has that too it's called a roaming profile roaming profile
 right so yes and so this is not quite that but this is this is allows you to do
 kind of a roaming profile right well this is way more than that because the
 roaming profile doesn't provide you any of the encaps of the encapsulation that
 mojo pack does I mean I mean remember you could literally install Firefox they've
 got problems with IE 7 right now I may be wrong when I think the Apple one does
 do that but I may be wrong provides real security encapsulate yeah basically
 everything's all kind of packaged up well okay but I guess I don't know that's a
 good question I don't know no access to the host because because you know oh I
 see what you're saying no I think you probably would access the host I think
 it's probably all living on the host yes and so so that's my point is it that
 what I see you're taking it with you it's completely portable right well but
 but not only portable and again I want to make sure we make this point it's it's
 encapsulated that is to say when when you install your mojo pack device into
 the machine it brings up the mojo pack desktop into which you log in and you
 have no access to the normal hosts resources you cannot get to the hard
 drive you cannot get to you you're able to access removable media you can see
 the host CD ROM and and and DVD and other USB devices but but basically you're
 only able to see those things which the mojo pack guys allow you to see it's
 also important to note that you do have to be logged in as an admin user a full
 strength user on the host they they have provisions which they will be making
 available to universities because they you could imagine in a university setting
 all the university students could have mojo pack you know dongles and dongles
 around their neck and they go to to bolted down limited user XP systems stick
 in their dongle and now they've got access to you know their own and their
 own portable environment and so there is a way that a lit that mojo pack can
 run as an admin user on top of a limited user host but that's not the normal
 retail version that's not what people can buy right now right now you do have
 the host that you that you that you that you stick your mojo pack into needs to
 be running as an admin in order for mojo pack to install itself and and make
 itself go because again it's it's installing a dynamic very low level
 kernel driver in order to perform all of this all these modifications to
 windows it's all it's also worth noting that there are sort of two profiles that
 have sort of surfaced for mojo pack users the the people at ringcube who did
 mojo pack all literally use mojo pack as their single environment they use
 small USB to hard drives as opposed to solid state drives and they have installed
 all of the applications they use I mean basically their entire PC is installed
 in a mojo pack drive and so what what they have when they come to work is
 literally an empty windows XP machine it's just it got a generic install it's
 sitting there with nothing on it they they come to work in the morning plug
 their drive-in bang they're looking at their desktop exactly as they left it at
 home because they've done the same thing at home they've got a generic windows
 XP install at home and when they come back from work they plug their drive in
 and their whole environment is portable and has moved with them including all
 the applications that they have installed so so you have this sort of this this
 high-end whole environment portability user where you where for example the
 sub the the relatively limited size of a USB dongle which is you know practically
 you know 4 gig maybe 8 gig today and the somewhat lower performance of a
 flash ROM device may not be enough for that kind of a user so you use a small
 lightweight you know portable USB drive then you've got somebody like I was
 pretending to be a couple days ago where I mean I I really wanted something in my
 pocket or on my keychain and that's entirely practical the there have been
 some postings on the net about slow performance problems with with mojo
 pack I don't see that at all as far as I could see I mean I was using a good
 SanDisk 512k high-speed USB device but but I've downloaded 3500 news group
 messages just as fast as I would have it on a regular PC they claim about a 5
 percent overhead of their of their system which is very low for this kind of
 work but it's really not doing much it's just filtering at the kernel API in
 order to sort of mutate the windows environment in order to mojo pack eyes
 the the host machine to hide the hard drive to allow you to get access to the
 networking layers and and so forth and basically to provide this mojo pack
 desktop another example of sort of the cluge-ness of this is if a personal
 firewall pops up a message it pops up on the underlying host desktop and you
 can't see it so to get around this the mojo pack guys are watching for anything
 popping up on the desktop underneath and then we'll provide you with a notice
 that something has popped up on the host desktop which which requires you to
 click the mojo bar flip over to the host and see what's going on one of the
 other irata is that if a personal firewall blocks something that you're
 doing in the mojo environment you may need to go back to the host and to permit
 the application which is running on mojo to go through I mean again these are
 these are consequences of the fact that windows was never designed to have this
 done it's a testament the fact that these guys are able to do it all is a
 testament to their courage and fortitude and and you know the fact that they had
 a really cool idea which I'm sure is going to be evolving and improving and
 getting better over time as they work out all of these sorts of you know dust and
 debris much as I remember personal firewalls being in the beginning and now
 they're much more solid so again I I don't want to put people off neither do I
 want to oversell this my and the reason I think that that this evaluation period
 is critical is people ought to give it a try it is you know everyone who sees it
 says whoa this is so cool I mean and I feel that way too if I were if my life
 were such that I was ever away from here and I wanted to carry an executable
 windows environment with me and I knew that there would be there would be
 host there would be available admin privileged windows XP machines wherever
 I was going to need to do something and I'm carrying all my data I mean it is a
 it is a really a cool solution and it works but it can be quirky for specific
 things so you'd want to make sure for example if you were someone who needed to
 use Adobe Acrobat's PDF creation capabilities that's just not working
 under mojo pack today because it's it's something that you could imagine they
 could be able probably get around to dealing with at some point thus my
 sense is that this is going to keep getting better and better also relative
 to licensing you've got this this 30 days or 200 boots and then you've got a
 buy it and don't forget that from the time people are hearing this there's a
 three-week window during which buying it is 2499 versus twice the price at
 $49.99 so keep that in mind too once you have bought it there is the
 ability to to migrate your mojo pack from one device to another they only run
 on USB 2-0 because USB 2-0 spec requires a unique serial number on every device
 so they're locking their license to it when you download this 9-meg mojo pack
 install and then do your install you create an account over on the mojo pack
 site a username and password on the mojo pack site and you use that that same
 username and password in order to subsequently access your device although
 you're able to change the password and I think they they prompt you to change the
 password the very first time you you use this so so you've you've installed one
 instance of mojo pack on one device if you outgrow that or you decide you want
 to try a faster USB or you want to move over to a hard drive or do whatever you
 want to they provide the facility for de-registering the current mojo pack
 install and copying it over to another device and re-registering it there so
 you are able to migrate your your purchased mojo pack to USB devices
 virtually unlimited I think there actually is a a high limit because they
 do want to prevent fraud you know some style of fraud from occurring but
 basically it would never be something that would impede mojo packs users I
 think though I mean it's something that really should be done at the operating
 system level it just doesn't seem like an independent software vendor has a
 chance of making this thing work I mean Microsoft changes one thing the whole
 thing collapses well the that level of kernel API is pretty stable I ask them
 about about Vista because of course Vista as we know is very hostile to
 anyone mucking around down in its innards and they claim that they have it
 running on I'm sure that the 32 bit beta interesting I think I think it's
 running under RC 2 and again the the kernel API is a well documented well
 structured well understood API all right so this is an accepted thing to do yes
 well it's you know it I don't know what they're gonna do under the 64 bit version
 of Vista in this in the same way that McAfee and Symantec are frozen out from
 from going in and mucking around I have to imagine that mojo pack would would be
 similarly prohibited until until as Microsoft has said with service pack one
 of Vista's the 64 bit Vista then they will provide an API but that's apparently
 only a monitoring API that's probably enough for Symantec and McAfee it may
 not be enough so it may be I mean this is again this is another example of why
 reluctant as I am to call this occluge that's the word for it because they just
 may never be able to do this under the 64 bit version of Vista because Vista
 won't let you go in and do this because again as I said it's its root kit ish
 behavior and Vista 64 bit is specifically anti-root kit right but but
 Leo really I mean you ought to try it I I'm encouraging people with all these
 caveats I'm so reluctant to try it Steve how do you get this thing off your
 system do you think it installs cleanly no no it's never on your never on your
 system no that's what's so nice is you you download the nine mags you you you
 give it a a USB device now they they suggest wait a minute it only
 modifies your system in memory on the fly it never changes your operating system
 correct it doesn't change the OS you originally install it you install the
 mojo pack onto nor does it ever change anything about a guest operating system
 I mean I mean that part I'm really clear about and it's why again it's it's you
 know I know I've been I've I've thrown up all these caveats but it actually does
 work if it doesn't if it doesn't modify my system well of course I'll try it why
 not yeah well and as I said you know installing VMware is a horrifying thing
 I mean it it creates virtual adapters it's just it's got stuff running
 constantly in the background it's got services running it's all this stuff you
 know VMware doesn't mojo pack does not do this it is it nothing on the system
 where I originally installed it I mean nothing was even installed there it the
 the little 9 meg installer just found my USB device asked me to choose which one
 I wanted to install it to and it moved itself over there nothing changed on my
 host system then when you install it and you plug it into guest systems it it
 just dynamically loads this driver in RAM nothing is written to the hard drive
 your your mojo view has no access to it to the registry to the hard drive or
 anything so that anything you do is encapsulated and you there's nothing to
 uninstall because it's never installed I mean it it is again I I think these guys
 are in you know the first phase of a very cool thing and then a year from now
 two years from now we're gonna look back at this you know at episode 63 if
 security now and go well you know we were right this thing had all kinds of
 wacky behavior I'm gonna I'm gonna make a deal they're gonna say Steve was right
 Leo was full of it cuz I don't think this is ever gonna happen and I think
 really if it does it should it should happen at the operating system level but
 all right if you think no no now Leo I'm not saying I disagree with you except
 we don't have it available well Microsoft's not doing it yeah Microsoft's not
 doing it and it's gonna take them generations you know VISTAs already
 done so it's not gonna be in VISTA this is not something I could see them adding
 in a service pack so it's gonna have to be in WISTA or whatever whatever comes
 after VISTA and that's gonna be a long time right so you know no one should hold
 out hope for for this I understand that I understand that but I agree with you
 I mean in the same way that I think a personal firewall should be in the OS
 because you know that's the right place for it you know there's notion of
 application portability installing normal hard disk targeted apps in a
 portable device this is a cool thing when people see this this is cool I mean
 and the mojo pack guys have have done as I said they they had a lot of guts and
 they've tackled something which is fundamentally hostile to windows but
 they're making it work and so again because it's a small download you get
 30 days to play with it it won't screw up your system it won't modify any guest
 systems and it does allow you to have to take normal regular non special windows
 applications and run them on a portable device and then it's really portable
 and it creates privacy and security encapsulation for for what you're doing
 on the mojo pack as they as I think I heard them say well we were talking the
 phone you know what happens in mojo pack stays in mojo pack I mean it is it is
 very cool it's just it was a huge challenge to do this I I give props as
 hackers absolutely I give props absolutely I salute them and and tip my
 hat I mean this is this is a very valuable thing that that you know and I'm I'm
 I'm feeling again 50 bucks seems like a lot of money on the other hand I'm
 charging 89 for my for my software so who might have talked but but it does
 allow you to move around your your purchased mojo pack from from device to
 device they they they suggest and this is all in the read me file that I did I
 do encourage people to read they suggest for example that if you can you
 reformat your dongle to ntfs rather than the default which will be a fat or fat
 32 file system obviously people who are using an iPod can't they're not able to
 reformat they're gonna have to leave it in its default fat format because they
 still want to be able to use their iPod you know on on a Mac I guess or on you
 know in the way they normally do so they're not able to to change that to
 ntfs but if you did have a standalone drive or a USB device which you're
 able to use with ntfs they're just saying security is better and and it is
 faster than fat oh and I forgot to mention that something that they did
 broke compatibility with true crypt I was oh boy now slow down slow down I was
 concerned about that so I asked them they they recognize they broke it they've
 come up with a temporary workaround that allows true crypt to be used and the
 next release will be completely true crypt friendly so our favorite ultra
 robust security tool can also be used with mojo pack in order to to allow a
 true crypt volume to be carried and to have to and where true crypt is running
 on mojo pack no longer do you need to install true crypt on the target system
 so that's even better than running true crypt by itself because if you had true
 cryptid a dongle or a drive you would need to install true crypt on the host
 machine in order to then have active portable access here true crypt is
 running in mojo pack giving you access to your to your true crypt partition or
 directories so I mean in some sense it's even better than then true crypt without
 mojo pack and these I mean they're committed to the issue of security and
 privacy so they're going to make it work and even better than it does now and it
 does work now although you you need to do some work around you might I mean if
 all you really need is email and browsing you there there are USB versions of
 Firefox and a Thunderbird and so forth that you carry on a USB key it keeps all
 your stuff on the key it doesn't have the same kind of encapsulation you're
 talking about but you can't you can do that well that's absolutely true and in
 fact you three which we'll be talking about in the future it is a is a specific
 platform for running things from flash there are you know the the real advantage
 of mojo pack is encapsulation because Firefox won't give you this kind of
 robust encapsulation if you did get something a virus or something in
 Firefox running from a dongle it would still have access to your seed drive and
 and so again I mean there are there real benefits to what the mojo pack
 guys have done that as far as I know are unique it's true that if you were
 carrying a virtual machine around in your dongle and you knew that you had
 VMware or parallels installed in any host machine you could simply launch
 your VM and then operate but that requires a serious hit to the the
 hosting platform mojo pack doesn't hit the hosting platform at all is flash
 fast enough to do this I mean you you're running stuff and not off the hard drive
 but off the flash well you are but the way windows operates first of all flash
 reads at about twice the speed that it writes another concern is that flash has
 a right limit there the actual the actual chemical technology of the
 non volatility of a flash has a maximum of about a hundred thousand right
 cycles so for example people who who arrange like flash booting Linux systems
 I in fact my I have myself a flash booting free BSD system that I built I had to
 go to to some links to not have a swapping partition on the flash and in
 fact to make sure that I was excuse me that I was mounting my flash partitions
 in read only mode so that the system would be logging to ram and not to flash
 because you you never want a situation where you're right where by default you're
 writing often and hard to your to your flash because it will end of life that
 device very quickly now Mark Thompson actually did some experiments where he
 burned out a flash in a couple of days wow just by booting a standard Windows
 system and Windows just thrashed the thing and and and killed it and well
 is now that flash is at least fairly cheap so you know you you might use it
 for six months and have to buy a new one well I asked this question of the
 mojo pack guys they've been using mojo pack for six months many of them on
 flash devices and naturally they've been testing it and pounding on it and using
 it like crazy not a single one of theirs has ever died I would I would
 encourage people not to use bargain basement you know cash register oh here's
 a $15 you know half a gig flash that you can get at the checkout stand by all
 means stay with with you know Lexar or Sandisk or or a high-end is there really
 a difference I really think there is yeah I mean certainly certainly in
 performance too because in order to get accelerator performance what they're
 doing is they're they're writing in parallel to many more flash devices inside
 in order to get multiple multiples of right speed and there's also something
 called right leveling which expensive flash has and cheapo flash doesn't what
 right leveling does is it actually distributes the rights so that even
 though you appear to be writing to the same logical location in the flash it's
 actually the flash itself is writing and it's doing sort of the equivalent of
 sector swapping on a hard drive it's actually writing to other physical areas
 which are then read back from that area in sort of in a content addressable
 scenario so the idea is it it it means that if you were only using part of
 your flash and like you know recording pictures deleting them recording them
 deleting them recording deleting them and like never filling up your flash if on
 a normal fat file system that would end up burning out the front of the file
 system way before way before the end you never read the end exactly yeah it's
 so so so so basically you end up killing this thing way before you need to but
 the the higher quality flash has right leveling built-in and it's
 automatically distributing those rights across the entire physical surface of
 the drive so it's really worth doing that these of course are not problems
 for for an actual little USB 2o hard drive those little drives you can get
 yeah now one of the thing they recommend that that is mojo pack recommends is
 that you that the first time if you're concerned about performance or if it
 seems sluggish I saw no sluggishness at all in my case I mean literally I'm I'm
 totally happy using this thing for for like mail web browsing new new news
 groups for example in and with a news reader in particular you really want to
 carry your whole environment around because it's all the messages that you've
 already read and all the messages that have occurred so that so that
 conversation threading works correctly so there I mean it's just it's not the
 same as going and doing like a web-based read of a forum where it is all being
 kept over on the server side but I mean I'm I was completely happy with the
 performance of this thing however by default Microsoft Windows turns off
 right caching for USB devices the reason is if someone yanked it out of the
 of the connection you might well have what's called a dirty cache in Windows
 where it has been deliberately buffering rights so as not to
 redundantly write to the device and also so as not to not to incur the
 performance penalty of doing so so so what happens is Windows realizes this is
 a USB device and it will turn off right caching you can go in to you know right
 click on my computer go to manage go go to the find find the USB device select
 the properties of it and they explain this in the mojo read me exactly what
 the path of clicks is to get there and then you do you deliberately turn on
 delayed writing that that means you need to shut down mojo pack through the UI
 and not just yank it out but of course most users know now they really ought to
 do a smooth shut down of a USB drive anyway really I'm oh yeah I didn't know
 that I thought Windows just kind of you know it handled it so I just pulled it
 out well it's on under Windows 2000 you have to do it but under you don't well
 no and the reason you don't is Windows is still trying to flush it however if
 you've ever done a large file copy even under XP it the file copy dialog will
 finish and if you've got a light showing access to the device it'll sit there
 and flash sometimes for 30 minutes because because Windows is it has flushed
 everything out of its out of its upper UI level but the kernel is still trying
 to write to an inherently slow writeable device which is what USB flash is so you
 really need to wait and what you should do is right click on the on the drive
 appearance in Explorer and and then select eject and wait for the eject to
 complete and then it's safe to remove so so anyway my point is that if another
 sort of a power user trick is you could disable or rather enable write caching
 which is not the default setting for a USB a USB portable device because Microsoft
 wants to keep the caches flushed and keep the drive current in case somebody
 yanks it out without shutting it down I actually didn't bother with that and I
 just saw no performance penalty I'm I'm really pleased with this so again I I
 want to make sure people understand this is you know version 1.0 actually it's
 1.0.1 at the moment we I believe this thing has a future I think people are
 right to be excited about it and it it it offers a lot of features the only
 caveat being you know Windows wasn't designed this way and so these guys
 have had to do deep hooks into the kernel in order to pull this off but I
 think for most people they have and it'll only be some people who have problems
 so again use that 30-day eval or your 200 boots you know as quickly as you can
 within that period figure out of the things that you think you want to do
 work without any trouble and if so you know then I think it's a great solution
 for you very good I mean obviously these guys are filling a perceived need
 there's no question about that and they're amazing hackers and since it
 doesn't in any way impinge on your system why not try it why not give it a
 shot yeah again it it's small and lightweight doesn't affect your system
 and it's you know seeing it work is to believe it Leo your attitude I mean my
 attitude change well I've tried it I mean I have seen it work okay yeah we
 try to call for help actually Cali demonstrated it and it was impressive I
 just it just makes me nervous m-o-j-o-p-a-c dot common as Steve said you can try
 it for free you know we've been talking about a free trial version of a spin
 right for some time I think you've really got to try that I don't know how I would
 do that as I said to you before Leo you know we we offer it with a complete
 money back guarantee I think that's the best way to do it well and and because
 the fact is the first time you use it you you get tremendous benefit from it's
 not an apple it's not a productivity application like word or or something
 else where it's like okay do I really want to keep using it after 30 days I
 in fact I we received a nice note from a security now listener just this week
 he said I just wanted to give you some more feedback on spin right I've been
 listening to security now since some of the earliest episodes and I've been
 thinking about getting a copy of spin right well I had just the right
 opportunity this past weekend a friend's computer started refusing to boot into
 Windows XP and I took a good look at it and found the Max door hard drive was
 going bad very bad oh he had over eight gigs of digital photos on it that he
 absolutely did not want to lose and I was having very little luck trying to
 copy the files off of it so I got a copy of spin right and ran it get this for
 two and a half days oh my I see I think sometimes you will give up because they
 don't realize it could take that long well he says he ran it for two and a half
 day straight until we had a power outage oh no it's like okay he said after that I
 decided to see what I could recover and I was able to easily recover all the
 photos it was great so do you mean a handle a power outage like that I mean
 it fails gracefully like that it fails gracefully that was something that was
 tested extensively back in the spin right 1.0 days and you know I put in the
 technology to make it do the right thing and you know two and a half days is
 extreme you know many people talk about it running on 250 gig drives in a few
 hours which it's certainly able to do but you know what happens is I mean
 spin right is really doing hard work you had to do a lot on that drive and when
 you compare this to taking the drive out and sending it somewhere right two and
 two and a half days is much less time than waiting multiple weeks to have some
 data recovery company fix it for you for way more than eighty nine dollars very
 impressive s p i n r i t e it's a g r c dot com and if you want to see more
 testimonials it's spin right dot info and of course g r c dot coms a place to go
 for 16 kilobyte versions of this for the bandwidth challenged also Elaine's
 great transcriptions she does those just for you because I know sometimes it's
 hard to follow but you can read along as you listen again g r c dot com visit
 twit dot TV we have an episode guide going back just as Steve does going back
 all the way to the very first episode so you can see what you've missed and and
 a lot of people download these shows much later I think it's the kind of thing
 people collect and they want the whole set I I get postings from people all the
 time saying that they just discovered us and they've been listening to all the
 back episodes so I'm not really happy that we have that I know it's a good
 thing it's absolutely a good thing to have if you like security now you might
 like a Windows weekly it's another podcast this time about Windows with Paul
 Therat very similar style Paul is a great Windows expert and we talk about
 not not specifically security but just Windows Vista and Microsoft and what
 they're up to and of course it's getting very interesting right now that's also
 available at twit dot TV your support is much appreciated you know we've had
 advertising for some time but as the advertising came on the show the
 donations dwindled that's kind of bad news because frankly the donations pay
 for the infrastructure the advertising only pays salaries so your two dollars
 a month if you like somebody somebody asked me well I like this show but I
 don't like that show can I just donate to this show yeah just you know put in
 your note when you when you donate the two dollars say it's for Steve that's
 fine and I'll I'll make sure that it only pays for the bandwidth that Steve
 uses for something I think I use a lot of bandwidth I think you do I think you
 do we do thank the great folks at Astaro who've been a sponsor for so long
 really they were they came to us and said we love what you're doing we want to
 support Steve and we'd like to become a kind of the flagship sponsor they make
 the Astaro security gateway and I think that's a marriage made in heaven for
 security now if you're a small or medium business network you need superior
 protection from spam from viruses from hackers complete VPN capabilities and
 intrusion protection content filtering and industrial strength firewall all in a
 very easy to use single high-performance appliance you want to try out the
 Astaro gateway contact ASTRO.com or call 877 the number four ASTRO you can
 schedule an absolutely free trial of the Astaro security gateway in your
 business and and then for non-business users you can download the software put
 it on an old machine you can even subscribe to all of the things like the
 anti-spam and any virus if you if you choose to it really is a great great deal
 ASTRO.com also thanks to Dell for their sponsorship with the show we have more
 Dell's picks on our special Leo's picks page it's twit.tv/dell somebody
 sent me a note saying Leo why do you refer to yourself in the third person
 like that well it's just what it's called the Leo's picks page they are my
 picks Dell is at the twit.tv/dell and anytime you buy a computer from Dell if
 you go through there we get credits so we'd appreciate it Steve next week we are
 going to do questions and answers episode 64 one of my favorite numbers
 being that it's a power of two as well oh yeah you know what if I keep when my
 kid my son was like six or seven he said listen daddy two four eight sixteen
 thirty two sixty four hundred twenty eight two hundred fifty six one thousand
 twenty four five twelve one thousand and I went wow how do you Henry you're gonna
 be good at computers he said oh yeah he goes all the way up to he was at that
 time going to four thousand ninety six I'm I was impressed I thought this guy's
 got a binary brain he's only shown aptitude as so far for a YouTube videos
 though so I don't know maybe it was just you know just for just to entertain
 myself Leo I used to practice seeing how far up I can go really it's pretty
 scary how high do you can you get up to four million it gets a little four
 billion it gets a little tough after that I had it why had it memorized up to
 like 10 or 11 places I think I mean decimal digits just you know it's like
 so you know some people memorize pie I memorize powers of two so maybe he's a
 little budding Steve Gibson we thank you for joining us we'll see you next
 Thursday and every Thursday on toot.tv for securing us see you Steve see you
