 It's time for Security Now, Episode 64.
 Let me think.
 There's something about that number.
 Oh, I know.
 That's how many squares they're on.
 A chess board.
 8 by 8.
 So that would be 4 by 4 by 4 by 4 by 4 by 4 by 4 by 4 by 4 by 4 by 4 by 4 by 4, which was
 mean, ladies and gentlemen, it's a mod for episode and time for your questions and answers.
 Hello Steve.
 Hey Leo.
 So, we had some fun with Mojo Pack last week and I hope people enjoyed that one.
 I'm sure we have questions about that and a lot more.
 Shall we just get right to them or do you have anything you want to catch up with?
 Nope.
 I think we're ready to go with a dozen listener Q&A and I have to say, Leo, as I'm reading
 through these postings, I did want to remind people, people seem to be finding it anyway.
 But at the bottom of the Security Now page at GRC, which is just grc.com/securitynow,
 the bottom of the page is a web form that anyone can use to send me questions, which
 I receive and do my best to read through.
 And you should emphasize, you do not answer individual questions.
 I get so many of them that I can't, but every time I'm preparing one of these mod 4 shows,
 I find myself thinking, wow, I really want the ability to answer more of these.
 So one of these days, we may actually, as I have threatened you before, switch maybe
 to mod 2 in order to double the frequency of doing Q&A.
 I really think people like them because one episode then covers many different topics.
 It allows us to talk about smaller things rather than just single big things.
 And we've got such an active, really interested audience that it's really cool.
 So let's kick things right off with question number 1 for Michael Klein, Fairfield, California,
 who says, I have a question for you.
 It was on your topic a couple of episodes ago, proxies.
 We only talked about one kind of proxies, but the corporate network I work on requires
 using a proxy to access the Internet.
 Obviously this allows them to track everything employees are looking at, even if the data
 might be sensitive personal information.
 Now I'm using SSL connections, you indicate that using an SSL connection prevents the
 use of a transparent proxy by ISPs.
 I'm wondering if an SSL connection prevents snooping by a corporate proxy or can a corporate
 proxy intercept the Internet's SSL connection?
 For instance, could a proxy set up two SSL connections?
 Oh, he's smart.
 This guy's smart.
 A client proxy connection and a proxy web server connection, decrypting in the information,
 scanning the content, re-encrypting the information and sending it along kind of a man in the middle
 attack.
 I think they do that, don't they?
 Uh-huh.
 And he says, can a proxy fake a certificate to make you think you have a completely secure
 connection between a client and web server when you really don't?
 Now we've talked about this a couple of times, and in fact, this is a great opportunity for
 me to clarify something that I wasn't clear about relative to certificate verification.
 So first of all, Michael is exactly right that there are corporate proxy servers which
 do intercept and exactly as he said, the web server sets up an SSL connection to the proxy.
 The proxy sets up an SSL connection to the target web server.
 But in between there, it decrypts, can, scan and typically does scan for content and then
 re-encrypts on the way out.
 However, and again, he's on the ball because what this requires is some sort of a certificate
 game being played.
 So in fact, proxies do perform, corporate proxies can be set up to perform exactly this kind
 of interception.
 However, in every case, the browser must be complicit in this.
 That is to say, what happens is the proxy will have an SSL certificate and it is necessary
 that the matching certificate be pre-installed in every corporate browser.
 Now again, that does happen and is happening to people who may or may not be aware of it.
 But what then happens is that when the user attempts to use an SSL connection, for example,
 maybe to go to Gmail and use Gmail's web browsing mail interface in order to have a truly secure
 and private interaction that is going to truly bypass the corporate proxy, the proxy will
 itself return its own certificate.
 Basically what it does is it creates a certificate for that remote website on the fly which it
 signs.
 Remember that in the past, we've talked about certificate and certificate signing and listeners
 can go back and look down at our crypto series to get the details of that.
 But basically, it creates on the fly a security certificate from that website.
 Now normally, for example, Google would have a certificate that was signed by Equifax or
 by Veracine or one of the major certificate signers and everyone's browser has those large
 companies, Equifax and Veracine and Microsoft and so forth, they have those certificates
 already installed in their browser so that they're able to validate the signature of
 the web server's signed certificate.
 So what happens in the corporate scenario is that the corporate proxy creates basically
 a fake certificate on the fly which it signs, it itself, that corporate proxy signs it.
 That's what it returns to the browser.
 The browser then looks in its cache of certificates and it will find Equifax, Veracine, Microsoft
 and Ajax company or whatever the company's name is and it will check to see that the
 signature of the remote server certificate is properly signed which it will be.
 So no alert will be presented to the user, the user won't know that anything untoward
 has happened and this ends up being a seamless connection.
 Can't you look at the certificate and see all of that going on?
 Now that is exactly the point I wanted to make and what I wanted to make very clear
 about how you can bust this happening and that is when you bring up a secure page, right
 click on the page and look at properties of the page.
 There's a view certificate option, what you want to look at is what's called the signing
 chain and if you look at that it will normally say like google.com and then there may be an
 intermediate authority but then there's a root authority which will be Veracine or Equifax
 or whomever signed it well.
 In this case that's the giveaway, it will be Ajax Inc or whatever the name was given
 to your certificate, probably the company's name.
 So you'll know immediately that the certificate you have received has actually come not from
 the actual server signed by a true universal authority but it was signed by your own local
 proxy server meaning that the connection terminates at the proxy server where it's being decrypted
 for whatever purpose is, although I have to say somebody at work sees you know the company
 name is probably not, it's not a red flag they're going oh yeah I don't know I'm going
 through the company but now you know that's a giveaway that the company may be intercepting
 the traffic.
 Well actually you know that they are definitely intercepting the traffic, you don't know what
 they're doing with that decrypted phase because if the certificate your browser has received
 from what it thinks is the website is in fact signed by the company then the data has to
 be decrypted as a result of the traveling through the SSL connection and coming out at the proxy
 server where it's re-encrypted.
 Now it may be that nothing is happening except the company is just adamant about proxying
 everything and so they've taken these measures but I do know that this is being done by some
 proxy servers and companies that want this level of control so it's always possible to
 detect it in that fashion.
 There's no way they could do it without having a certificate that said something other than
 the site you're going to.
 No what you would if they tried to do that you would get a pop-up dialogue warning you
 it doesn't match.
 It doesn't match.
 I've seen that error okay yes okay say the certificate doesn't match what do you want
 to do?
 Yeah.
 Just temporarily or forever or whatever John lurking somewhere in New York writes could
 you please talk about SSL well Michael was talking about SSL I really don't understand
 what it is what it means what it does.
 I mean I sort of know what SSL connections do but I don't know how they actually work
 that's a great question.
 Well it's so great that I'm going to give that an entire episode I thought I'd answer
 it really quickly sort of in an overview mode but I thought we had really covered it so
 I looked back at our work after our crypto series and I never really addressed the mechanism
 of SSL.
 Its origins were with Netscape those are the guys that came up with SSL one and it turns
 out there were a couple sort of boundary condition problems with it that were fixed but basically
 the guys at Netscape did it right and now SSL also known as TLS which is a transport
 layer security it in I mean it's it's such a great solution that it's worth really just
 stopping and explaining in detail how that works with certificates and crypto and everything
 and we do have all the background having really covered cryptography very well so I want to
 do that but but you know the short version of John's question it's a short answer to
 John's question is that it's a it's a means for allowing a true authentication if if you
 choose true authentication and very strong in industrial strength encryption of data
 through a channel such that they're a man in the middle attack cannot be performed if
 you are securely authenticating the endpoints which SSL does provide thanks to certificates
 and somebody passively sniffing the traffic has no ability in you know the lifetime of
 the universe sort of time frame to decrypt that traffic so it is a you know it is proof
 against anyone intercepting the traffic it'll it'll it allows you to authenticate that is
 to prove the identity of the endpoint given that for example as we were just talking about
 with Michael's question that you check the certificates that's certainly important but
 it it provides these mechanisms and it's just a it's a terrific means for for moving data
 across the internet solving problems of security and privacy and we're going to give it a whole
 answer in its own episode good I mean of course people have seen it when they go to their bank
 you said Gmail my email provider uses it's a it's a it's it's basically relatively free
 and a good thing to use I mean you just have to get a certificate well and anytime you see
 HTTPS that's secure stands for secure which is SSL great yeah Tom Krauske of St. Louis
 celebrating his world series has been having trouble actually as we record this we don't
 know how St. Louis is done in the world series but I'm sure it's been wonderful has been having
 trouble sending email to a few specific people he asks could you guys talk about how to get
 around port 25 blocking I have email I said to my sister and a friend but it returns to
 me with this line connected to some IP address but sender was rejected remote host said 550
 another IP address blocked by LDAP colon OU equals RBL MX DC equals Comcast E sequels net
 yep we've never talked about what are called real time black lists and and so Tom's issue
 is not that he's got a problem with port oh there's more I didn't see there's another
 page BL 0 0 4 blocked for spam I left that out he said I've been told Comcast is blocking
 port 25 my S.P. says only support email on port 25 this sounds like a gunfight at the
 OK Cara well so he's not a Comcast customer he's trying to send a Comcast is that what's
 going on well whichever way because it isn't clear because we don't have his IP right but
 essentially he doesn't have a port 25 problem he's got a false spam triggering problem right
 a real time black lists are are are essentially lists of of known or believed spammers so what's
 happening is he's able to send email apparently just in general to lots of people but his sister
 and this friend are unable to receive his mail so what's happening is that the SMTP server
 at their end that is their is P's SMTP server is doing everything it can to block spam so
 it's accessing these real time black lists and comparing the IP of his SMTP server against
 the list and finding that that IP or that range of IP is a is a believe to be a sender
 of spam he's been black listed he's he well he's been black listed but not his IP were
 actually his ISP most likely his ISP right yeah exactly so it could be him it could be
 him but it's most likely his ISP well it can't be him because the connection is coming from
 his S that's right that's right not not actually from from him directly so so unless he's running
 his own mail server but that seems unlikely exactly so so so the way so so you know even
 for a guy who's innocent I mean you know Tom can be completely innocent but what's happened
 is other customers of his ISP are infected with spam sending bots and zombies these things
 are so other people's machines are infected their depositing spam on the ISP server which
 is the ISP's SMTP server which is in turn relaying it as spam servers do all over the
 net people are receiving this spam backtracking it to the to this ISP's SMTP server and black
 listing it you're being kind you're being kind because unfortunately the problem with
 real time black holes is you can get black hold for blacklisted for all sorts of things
 maybe not even sending spam well and that's the problem yes is there's a high level of
 false positives in all of this most of these as we know most of these zombies do don't
 go through the the ISP's mail server they do their own mail server that's why these
 ISPs block port 25 you get caught very quickly if you try to forward mail through your ISP's
 mail server so it may be that the ISP had you know we did some web hosting for somebody
 who was a spammer there's lots of ways I've had addresses get on these black hole black
 lists and it's very hard to get them off yep you just have to wait yep maps orbs he
 had an RBL what was it RBL MX something yeah so what is so what is that LDAP that's that's
 just a lookup of that yes okay yeah RBL MX blocked by LDAP colon OU equals RBL MX so it could
 be as ISP was it fault but or somebody on the ISP is it fault or could be the black holes
 blackless it fault but either whether he's not going to get air email through is there
 any recourse anything you can do well okay here's the problem as you said ISPs are blocking
 port 25 so what that means is that the only thing he could do would be to find some other
 email server so use Gmail use Yahoo use Hotmail exactly if he simply you know basically he's
 not able to use his ISP's email his ISP is blocking his his direct connection to other
 remote server so we can't do that in order to avoid his blacklisted SMTP server so all
 the only he can do is use a complete third party email solution I think if you sign up
 for a Gmail account you can use their SMTP server for outgoing mail that would be a free
 way to do it I believe you can I know that you can receive using pop yeah I think you
 could send out yeah I don't think you can't oh okay I don't I mean I have looked for doing
 that and I have not seen a way to do fast mail will allow you to do that that's a paid of
 course service and I bet you if you paid for Yahoo mail you to be able to use an SMTP server
 from them well again that would open them up to being to being a spam relay so well but
 if they start seeing a lot of traffic coming from one person then they just cut them off
 right can can you can you pay for oh no you can't pay for Gmail you're talking about yeah
 yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah Jason Bennett in Chesterland Ohio is a bit worried
 he asks with all of the IE issues that always seem to come up I thought of a question is
 there the same vulnerability issue if you use the IE tab plug-in for Firefox that's any
 plug-in that lets you continue to work in Firefox but actually open a site in IE within
 Firefox yep and of course that's a problem when you open the tab you are basically running
 the windows IE control this is the same problem for example that and and it's the reason that
 Outlook Express or Microsoft Outlook has email problems because that that preview and and
 the the actual file viewer is the same viewer it's the it's the Internet Explorer viewer that
 allows the display of web pages in in in mail similarly when you use the IE tab they haven't
 obviously brought along an entire Internet Explorer version of their own they're actually
 using the the component ability of windows to just take the IE window and move it into
 the Firefox tab so any security vulnerabilities that exist in IE will bite you if you use the
 IE tab under Firefox same is true anytime IE is rendering a page in Outlook in an application
 that uses IE to render a HTML you're always at risk yeah just look at that but I thought
 I remembered an article on life hacker you can use Gmail as an SMTP server SMTP Google
 dot com you'll have to you know kidding yeah you'll have to use your Google account you
 have to have a Google Gmail account obviously and you'll use TLS under the secure connection
 and you can use their SMTP server very very cool I'm gonna do that Lee I actually have
 a an application for sending stuff through Gmail I didn't know that would work well and
 I remember there are a number of people I've talked to have hard times sending email out
 in various situations and they both like when they're on the road and so forth so they just
 use Gmail very neat thank you Google we'll see if they keep that up now that we've mentioned
 it maybe the end of that Phil Hendy from Swindon that's in the UK says after you after
 using shields up my PC behind a router passes all tests it's stealthy except for the ping
 ICMP echo request I can't find a way to disable this and if I did manage to do this what limitations
 if any would I face yep we get this question a lot so I wanted to pause and you know Leo
 you doing that British voice reminds me I would love our listeners to hear you switching
 to DJ mode why would you like that there Steve it's a beautiful Wednesday after then a Thursday
 after then we're doing a security now right now 1240 in the city 58 degrees so why would
 you want that Steve I just think I know that you don't have a few times in the call for
 help studio and I have the first time I heard that I said oh cool little you know Leo has
 that whole you know day voice what I worked in radio I had a dog like that wait a minute
 I still work in radio we people talk like that I don't know why Wow anyway okay let's
 get back to Phil's question he's not done now yeah a lot of people ask the question so
 I wanted to address it he mentions he's behind a router so what's happening is he's of course
 got a Nat router which is inherently going to be give him tons of incoming protection
 so naturally he's going to be fully stealth some routers however will still echo a ping
 so so he's going to fail shields up full step or true stealth test as I call it because
 I do send a packet just to see if there's a response what what he can do is first of
 all he might look around the user interface some user interfaces have a very clear ability
 to specifically turn off echoing ICMP pings so if you if you're sorry would first say
 look through the routers security configuration or or WAN security or WAN tab to see if it
 already offers you the ability to turn off ICMPs and if it doesn't what you can do is
 use the DMZ feature we've talked about the DMZ the so-called demilitarized zone which
 is what DMZ stands for where unsolicited traffic is routed to a specific machine on
 your network this is what people have to do for example if they want to run a web server
 or FTP or you know if they explicitly want to send unsolicited traffic somewhere that's
 where they use the DMZ to specify which machine gets it this is not the normal configuration
 because as we know what makes a NAT route or such a good security appliance is that unsolicited
 traffic is simply dropped and only traffic coming back from connections that were first
 established from the inside out are allowed back from the outside in but all you have
 to do is configure your routers DMZ to a non-existent IP for example if you're if in your private
 network behind the router you were 192.168.0.1 through 50 for example you could just aim
 it at 192.168.0.222 something you know high up out of the way that's not ever going
 to be an IP of a machine so what happens is that ICMP packet and any other traffic it
 would be unsolicited come through the router but there's nowhere for it to go inside your
 network so it simply gets dropped in the same way that the router would normally be stealthing
 that's very clever I never thought of doing that now most I've seen almost all routers
 have somewhere in there a way to turn off ICMP but I have to say I bet you you could
 make a lot of money by just going around to people's houses Steve and looking over their
 shoulder while they say well you think navigated through I'm just looking at my D link menu
 and there are so many places it could be hiding and I'm just yes routers have gotten very
 sophisticated and there's no standard there's no way well right I'm sorry to interrupt one
 of the thing that is worth mentioning is you might also upgrade your firmware people don't
 generally upgrade their router firmware for now unless they have some specific need to
 but router manufacturers are more or less continually fixing problems and adding features so it might
 well be that when you bought your router it did not offer the ability to block ICMP echo
 requests from going back but if you just brought it to a current firmware build you might find
 find that that feature had been added alright moving along to our another question here from
 UK to Minnesota we go a listener named Brian has been pondering virtual machine technology
 we did a couple of episodes on that he writes more than two we covered it pretty yeah he says
 I've been hearing that only Windows Vista ultimate edition oh this is the new license agreement
 thing we'll be able to run in a virtual machine I guess I understood that there is no way the
 OS would know it was running in a virtual machine can Microsoft enforce this and if so how this is
 actually a conversation Paul and I had on Windows weekly when we were talking about these new
 license agreements and he was of the opinion it's unenforceable independent of of the legal
 enforceability it is certainly possible for Microsoft to detect this we talked about this during the
 episode on blue pill because remember that the idea was that you could run some software there
 would switch your system into virtual machine mode on the fly literally without a reboot suddenly a
 a hypervisor as it's called would be loaded and run and I mean literally your screen doesn't even
 blink nothing it's just suddenly been subverted now the question was that you know whether this is
 a detectable thing because with modern virtualization technology everything can be captured because
 the chip itself the processor itself supports virtualization in at the hardware level there there
 isn't a way in sort of broad brush wise to detect it except it's so difficult to do a perfect job
 of virtualization so for example you might be able to virtualize a machine more easily that was not
 on the net but for example time is very difficult to virtualize that is the passage of time there I
 mean you could argue that okay well if we knew that certain instructions that we're gonna take
 longer when the machine was running in a in a VM mode their timing would be different and it is
 the case that that that instructions are some instructions that have to go through this extra
 hardware virtualization take way longer than when they're not so you would imagine that software could
 simply time the execution of the instruction but the timer itself can be manipulated by the
 virtualization layer so that the time appears to be the same the problem is if you have access to
 the net you are able to access time servers now the job would require intercepting them too and
 faking them so I guess my point is if Microsoft really wants to to catch people running Vista in
 VMs and you have to imagine Microsoft does really want to catch them given this this growing propensity
 that we're seeing on Microsoft's part of you know bolting down the licensing and enforcing it with
 technology I'd have to imagine that Microsoft would be able to penetrate the the virtualization
 layer and detect that something is going on that they don't want to allow bottom line is you
 get it is detectable it's just hard to do you'd have to be fairly motivated to do it to make the
 effort to do it we know what ultimate addition is going to cost is there any i think it's 300
 bucks it's very expensive that's if you buy it you know straight out of the box there are upgrades
 and so forth right so yeah i think that uh yeah i don't know i mean they they know for instance if
 you move a virtual machine to another machine they ask for activation again now so they're getting
 fairly smart about this i would gather i would guess you probably right they are motivated they've
 certainly written into the written into the uh well i guess the premise is uh if you're a home user
 you're buying windows Vista basic what are you doing a virtual machine thing for exactly uh but
 as i pointed out to Paul at the time well i think more and more users are going to start using
 virtual machines maybe even home users who want security so uh let's see here um Daryl from Kansas
 says oh it's a mojo pack question our last episode i tried mojo pack and mocha five usb
 solutions both of which you mentioned on security now then i thought hey how do i know i'm not
 installing a rootkit spyware or whatever by installing these question do you check out that
 stuff before mentioning these products on your show i went to macafie site advisor keyed in mocha
 five dot com it came back with a green check meaning we tested this site and didn't find any
 significant problems i did the same for mojo pack and receive the message no results found for mojo
 pack dot com so i submitted it for review do you do that um yes of course you do i will i will never
 casually mention a product you know from some questionable site and in fact people who have listened
 to all of our podcast will hear me you know very carefully say when i do mention you know a an
 underground site or or a site which is known to be uh a hacker or a cracker site i mean i mean i
 go to great pains to make sure people understand there's there's just no way that you know an up
 an up an up front company like mojo pack or mocha five where you know who i do i go over their site i
 look at their background i figure out what's going on i mean i i do i'm not saying that i'm you know
 checking in detail everything that these companies are doing but i i'm certainly looking to verify
 that these are you know well-known reputable companies you know finance with venture capital
 or founded by ex stanford professors uh in the case of mocha five and i mean so so i'll be very
 careful when i talk about things and that that could have a negative consequence and and caution
 people that that you know that's the kind of URL we're talking this is the guy who discovered
 spyware darryl come on he's not gonna put spyware on your sister but we should point out that you
 know there there are lots of nefarious sneaky people who are trying all the time to do this so
 mistakes could happen but steve i know is assiduous and protecting you and it would never checks
 everything yep never let anything go by agent smith uh obviously not his real name hiding somewhere
 in deepest australia writes well we experienced our first really serious d-doss attack a few days
 ago and it's quite an exciting experience exciting in the way i imagine being shot is shot at as
 exciting the there were network engineers doing what they could while senior management's attitude
 was uh if not explicitly stated get us back on the end now anyway if memory serves you and leo
 covered d-doss in your internet weaponry episode a few months back steve is steve knows more about
 d-doss than he even lets on yeah even then have there been uh any new countermeasures developed to
 help deal with d-doss is just their distributed denial of service attacks where a bad guy gets
 a bunch of machines thousands maybe more attacking you all the same time i'm guessing that the only
 way to reduce the impact is to install big pipes redundant network hardware and not to piss off
 the various attackers but i thought i'd ask apologize for not giving my real name might
 management's a little spooked by the experience and want to keep it as quiet as possible rightly so
 there are um i this is a great question and of course i sort of keep my eye on what's going on
 with denial of service because you've been d-dossed um have been in the past and you know have had
 lots of interesting experiences you know talking to isp's and and to other users the the bottom line
 is that bot networks now the these remote controlled trojan zombie whatever you want to call them bot
 networks are so large that that dealing with the denial of service attack that is sufficiently big
 is really a problem it's important to note for example though that that the size of the attack
 is very important in the old days when i was running my the grc servers here with me
 only at the other end of two t ones i had 1.54 megabits twice so you know a little over three
 megabits of total bandwidth so you know three computers who or or maybe maybe ten but certainly
 not hundreds or thousands you know a small handful of machines pounding on me could easily saturate
 my pipes at that point and you know take grc off the net because the servers at the far end of the
 t ones would would be filled with you know the the connection would only be delivering a high
 percentage of garbage and not any of the good content now there are companies that are in the
 business of protecting people from big denial of service attacks and again it's all a matter of
 scale what do they do just they throw pipe throw ban with that and yes exactly as as agent smith
 here as said they have really really big pipes and they set up some proxies so that the proxy responds
 to the tcp sin request to establish a connection and then if it's a spoofed sin the proxy will
 respond to it but the but they'll there isn't a machine at the spoofed ip address so that that
 their sin act going back from that the big pipe proxy just flies off to never never land and
 has never heard from again only real people who send a sin because they want to establish a tcp
 connection to the server they respond to the sin act the proxy then turns around and opens a connection
 to the the actual web server that is that is cowering behind this big pipe proxy server
 and receives a request so the attack flood is completely blocked that way but these big pipes
 meanwhile are being flooded with stuff and if the pipes are not big enough or if even if the
 proxy servers that are attempting to respond to all this sin traffic are not fast enough you'll
 still end up limping along a little bit however this is what the gambling sites that have been
 under such trouble with the denial of service attacks and other sites that really have to stay
 on the net in order for their well-being to be preserved these are the kinds of services that
 that they've had to move to and notice that these big pipes are expensive even when they're not
 being used so what's happened is it's changed the cost structure of internet connectivity you can
 get very inexpensive internet connectivity that isn't protected like this and if you're not a target
 and you don't piss off anybody as as agent smith said you're probably okay if you're a high value
 target and it's really important then you stay on the net then what you end up doing is paying a
 lot more for your internet connectivity because you're having to finance your shared piece of this
 of the infrastructure to deal with attacks when they happen even if they don't so i mean it it is
 something that has raised the cost of of bandwidth for people who are high value targets and but
 there is really no other solution there isn't anything i mean even theoretically possible
 that a small company can do to prevent themselves from just being taken off the net during a
 significant denial of service attack again they could increase their bandwidth increase the quote
 the size of their pipes in order to withstand larger attacks but attacks now are so big because
 there are literally tens of thousands even hundreds of thousands of bots in these networks that there's
 just they're able to produce so much bandwidth just unplugging your equipment and taking a vacation
 is is the recommended course of action so another way people do this is by changing to a different
 IP address and uh but then you if the attack is aimed at not the IP address but the name that's a
 problem well you know i don't have to tell you about dns propagation problem yeah and that's the
 other thing sure you know you've had those for a few weeks when when when you changed uh servers it
 takes a long time to catch up when you change your IP we've talked in the past about various schemes
 for kind of defeating denial of service attacks and none of those really pan out well i mean
 theoretically that much bandwidth has to go somewhere you just can if somebody's flooding your pipe
 it's flooded yep it's over there's nothing you can do brian scallen asks from London the new
 firefox 2.0 browser privacy settings allow by the way just came out this week or actually last week
 allow or disallow cookies without distinguishing between first party and third party cookies like
 an explore uh there is an option to explicitly allow disallow cookies from user specified sites
 but even then it doesn't distinguish between the different types it would seem to be an all or
 nothing approach to cookie handling is it less safe as a result wow that's bad news it is so
 badly i can't believe that i am so disappointed they removed under all prior versions of firefox
 up to two there was a nice setting in the ui that said allow cookies from the the target site only
 and you could turn that off and you got exactly what i recommend and what we've talked about and
 what we will be in the future because you know i've i've invested heavily in third party cookie
 um awareness on grc for a bunch of stuff that hasn't yet gone public and and i know what a
 percentage of of users have third party cookies on what is it would you would you describe what
 a third party cookie is well the idea is that a cookie is a token which a site you're visiting
 gives your browser which then it returns for successive requests the idea is that and that this
 again is something that originated as did ssl originated from netscape the when when a browser
 makes a connection and requests a page that's a call what we'll call it a transaction a web
 transaction they're asked for the page then it asks for all the gifs and jpgs that are there
 and other assets in order to populate the page then the user sits there and and looks at it and
 decides what they want to do and then may click a link elsewhere on that site or somewhere else
 on the internet well if they go to a different page on that site the browser makes a new request
 asks for the page and all the other goodies that the page contains and then the user looks at it
 again the point is there is no way to link those two pages that is there's no way to know that the
 same user who look at the first page then looked at the second page because they are completely
 separate transactions now if we were in a proxy free world the server might look at the ip
 and notice oh look we we got a request from this user's ip a minute ago so it's the same guy
 except that we know isp's we just start start finished talking about isp caching proxies isp
 proxies are the will have the ip which is coming to the to the server so the server cannot use
 the apparent client ip in order to disambiguate all of the traffic coming to it so what Netscape
 did was they created this thing called a cookie which is part of the headers the it's part of the
 request and the reply headers at the beginning of the query or the response from the browser or
 from the server the idea is that when the client browser makes a request it checks to see if it has
 a cookie as it's called a cookie is just and it's called an opaque token meaning that it's some blob
 of data that has no particular meaning to the browser but it does mean something to the server
 which gave the browser the cookie normally it's you know some as a little blob of crypto stuff or
 serial number that's been encrypted or something the idea being that the browser if it's got a cookie
 if I'm if I'm at google.com and I'm and and the browser is about to make a request it looks to see
 if it has a google.com cookie and if so it adds that to the into the headers in the request that
 allows google to check its database and see who it is that that this user is it for example it allows
 you to stay logged into Gmail over time it allows you know this is the mechanism that allows eBay
 to know once you log in who you are at as you move along there there are there are other approaches
 that involve putting this sort of information up in the URL but cookies are a very nice means for
 doing it and I mean and they work really well the problem is and this is something that Netscape
 sort of considered but didn't get worried enough about is that all assets that are populating the
 page are cookie enabled not just the main query for the page but for example the images banner
 images all of that stuff well exactly banner ads are the trick because companies like double click
 major ad services realize that hey we can give users a cookie too when they ask for an image on
 our page you know and and that's a unique token that follows the user around the net and that's
 the problem is is these third party cookies as they're called a first party cookie is a cookie
 between you and the site you're visiting a third party cookie is a cookie which your browser gives
 when your when when it asks for an asset not from the site you're visiting but for example
 from an advertising servers now why does it matter if double click gives me a cookie on when I go
 to the cnet page well what what matters is that there is there essentially that cookie you get when
 you go to the cnet page is returned to double click if they're an advertiser on msnbc or an
 advertiser on microsoft so they can follow me around cnet can't follow me around msnbc can't
 follow me around but the advertiser that's common to all those sites absolutely can yes they can
 know where i've been it's third party cookie tracking and it is it is absolutely done
 everywhere possible to and essentially to compile a a dossier a profile of all the sites you visit
 now you may say well that's harmless but if you give one site some personal information and they
 can track that and combine that with the cookie suddenly they're starting to really build quite a
 bit of information i'm about yes in fact there are sites that have been set up um there were sites
 that offered like free prizes if you just you know it's like here here's a chance to win a free
 prize fill out this form these sites are operated by the advertising companies they contain ads from
 the advertising company thus they are supplying that advertiser cookie and they provide the data
 you fill out well i mean it is the average it's a it's a front put up by the advertiser company to
 get your name address uh physical address phone number email address and essentially to acquire
 non anonymous information from users oh interesting they're able to sell this and they they then
 merge that with everything else they know about you they know if you went to to uh some search site
 and we're now spent three weeks searching about hiv aids because another problem is the the the
 so-called referrer and we and we'll talk about this because i mean i i've got a real issue with
 third-party cookies um the referrer in searches contains the information that you search about
 turns out that's provided in the query to the advertiser so advertisers not only know all the
 sites you go to they know what things you search for when you use search engines and as we have seen
 in the past you compile enough information like that you know everything about somebody i am i'm
 just uh just because i couldn't believe this just downloaded and installed firefox too and he's
 absolutely right there the only cookie management is to turn it off or leave it on they've completely
 gutted what used to be a pretty good cookie management tool now you have one checkbox
 it says accept cookies from sites yes or no and then you can have exceptions so you probably would
 want to say uh you know put double click dot net and always you know if you could add that list at
 least that would let you block the major guys but it's not it's not a good alternative the good news
 is this is configurable in firefox two oh but but not through the ui you need to use the
 configuration file and and that it is possible to still say i only want to accept first-party
 cookies i want to deny third-party cookies so they just don't expose it in their regular
 interface i have no idea why they took it off the ui but yes you do about colon config will show
 you all of these settings exactly and do you know what the setting is that we have to change um yes
 it's network dot cookies dot something all right um let me look we're we're gonna talk about it my
 site will be talking about it i don't have it yet so don't go looking for it but they must have just
 run out of ui space i mean they must have had other stuff they thought was more important they didn't
 want to you know it just feels like why would you remove something like this and
 they may have figured that people don't care or don't know well it's certainly the case that people
 don't know i believe you know you care if they find out if they understand and so i've i've invested
 a lot of time in engineering uh over at grc and it'll be another major feature of grc in fact it's
 it's i did the the menuing system because cookies was something i wanted to get done as well as the
 oh the long-awaited open vpn documentation both of which are waiting for me to get the menus online
 which is the next thing i'm gonna do when i get back to grc and uh anyway but but i'm looking at the
 i'll tell you there's no obvious place i mean i see a lot of network cookies always accept session
 cookies network cookie there's one that's called network cookie cookie behavior that's the one you
 you set that it's i think it's normally zero it's zero and you set it to one and it only it allows
 first party cookie you wouldn't even know to set that it doesn't say anything about first party
 third party so you again you can surf to about colon config and change network cookie network dot
 cookie dot cookie behavior to one by double clicking it and that's gonna do it wow yes and if you do a
 google search for firefox 2.0 third party cookies you'll find a bunch of controversy about this and
 dialogue and and these instructions are available there that's that's very disheartening that they
 would take such a big step backwards yep all right i'm sorry just very very upset gary swan sends
 us a great question from england if my isp uses a transparent proxy transparent proxy how do i
 know if i'm getting the latest web page even if i reload the page surely i get the page from the
 proxy cache instead of for the latest uh page from the web server is is that true he's exactly right
 wow if your isp use the transparent pro a transparent proxy there's no way you can get around it
 um you know all of your web access is going through your isp they're filtering it there's
 nothing you can do and there's no way around it i mean they're there if the if the cache is not
 set up correctly it will it will not be it will be keeping a copy and feeding that back to you
 um they're just there isn't a way to avoid that hopefully the um the the cache is configured so that
 and the web server the foreign is configured so that if pages need to be kept fresher then the the
 web server is serving content that says do not cache this or this expires in five minutes or
 or whatever period of time and so so again it requires that the rest of the system be functioning
 correctly but if you've got a cache in the way which is misbehaving there's no way to get around it
 wow wow that's just the nature of caching now you could do something like you know go to a third
 party service like anonymizer or a tor uh a tor proxy that we will be talking about so you could
 come up with another way to circumvent the transparent cache by not by not routing your web traffic
 through your ISP at all and so you know that there are like you know ways like that but it you know
 requires a lot of work right mottie jannick of needville texas was wondering if a virus or worm
 edits my dns config could i get sent to a malicious dns server website on the internet it seems like
 a security issue similar similar to editing the hosts file i agree if a bug gets us deep into
 my system i'm in trouble anyway is this a concern though that's that's an interesting way to
 screw up somebody's system yeah it's a nut yet another clever way that windows could absolutely
 be messed up uh dns uh in in in network configuration can be sent to does not have to be set to your
 ISP's dns in fact uh we got a bunch of people on our newsgroups who have found faster dns
 servers and in fact leo uh you're now becoming a fan of the open dns uh i was briefly changed
 changed away from them actually yeah i i have also so so the point is that your computer
 can be instructed to go to whatever dns server you tell it to if something gets in your machine
 changes those settings then yes you're in trouble on the other hand this is where i remind people
 if something is in your machine enough to change your dns settings you're already in trouble if you
 were on a mac it is asking for a password anyway but it doesn't let me change it without asking
 for a password that's why security is so important right scott burr of beaverton or again says now
 that internet explorer seven is out can we safely go back to using it for browsing the internet the
 reason i ask i still don't see any new feature that allows us to turn off javascript for selected
 sites uh that is javascript can install malware programs as we've talked about before through buffer
 overruns uh you're a little more worried about javascript than i am but uh but is ie7 uh better
 protecting against these exploits it is as good as six and the mechanism still exists the way to do
 this is it's not clear and again it's it's one of the things i i will it's on my list to get around
 documenting although we have talked about it i e has this notion of zones you've got the trusted
 zone the internet zone uh the untrusted zone what you're able to do is by default all websites are
 in the internet zone that is their exterior their external and and when you when you access a website
 i e uses the security settings for the internet zone so if you turn that security setting all the
 way high it will disable javascript for all sites on the net now that's a problem because you may
 want javascript for amazon or ebay or google certainly you will like to have for example google mail
 needs javascript in order for its gmail browser based stuff to function so then what you do is you
 place the specific sites that you like and you trust in your trusted sites zone star dot google
 dot com star dot microsoft dot com star dot ebay dot com and so forth and then automatically when
 i e six or seven are visiting those sites um the the the browser looks in the list of trusted sites
 see that you trust this site and it uses the the lower security the default security um for
 only the sites you trust so as with i e six you able to do the same thing with i e seven and
 it is the way i surf i mean it is absolutely the way i use i e in a secure fashion sites i visit
 never have scripting enabled um at all and only when i decide to trust them then i lower my shields
 and allow scripting to function on the site well now we know in fact after this mozilla the fire
 fox thing i'm thinking maybe i'll start using i e seven at least it can block third party cookies
 without going into some strange config file yeah well that's it for it the day we have 12 questions
 12 answers i'm sorry to come to the end of it but the it's been a very interesting story i have to
 say we thank the folks at a star over making this all possible they are sponsors on security now
 and without them well i just don't know what we do a star star actually we're just we love
 having them on because they're a very very exciting company they do great stuff they do the
 star of security gateway you probably heard us talk about the star of security gateway if you're
 a smaller medium business network uh our business and your network needs superior protection from
 spam from viruses from hackers uh complete VPN capabilities intrusion protection content filtering
 and an industrial strength firewall who knew that it could do so much one little box could do all
 that one single easy to use high performance appliance that's the star of security gateway
 you want to try it free in your business contact a star o as t a r o dot com or call eight seven
 seven the number four as t a r o built on open source this stuff is really good and of course if
 you're a non-business user you could download a free version just for yourself at a star o dot com
 also want to point you to twit dot tv slash del that's where the leo's picks live on the special
 page on the twit site if you're buying a del computer if you're looking for a del computer if
 you're getting ready for vista take a look at the great del deals i'm loving this xps 700 oh man
 with a nice computer but there's lots more there at twit dot tv slash del steve gibson of course is
 at g r c dot com home of spin right more more happy spin right customers to tell us about every time
 we do the show you got somebody good saying something great um i mentioned remember last week i i
 mentioned the guy who for whom it took uh two and a half days to recover his friends eight gigs of
 photos uh the the drive was completely gone it was a max door drive that was like in really bad
 trouble um and i mentioned that you know even though two and a half days seemed like a long time
 you know compared to sending it off somewhere it was you know substantially less well i i did
 get a piece of mail he uh this guy writes a week ago i started my day with a blue screen of death
 advising that i had an unmountable boot volume efforts by a del tech only uh lead him to the
 conclusion that we should reformat the drive and lose all my data nothing would recognize the drive
 and all of the check distance man's in the book could not even see it or result in anything but the
 same blue screen on every ruby on every reboot a max door utility that i ran from a downloaded file
 advised me to return the drive for a replacement after getting estimates ranging from four hundred
 dollars to twenty seven hundred dollars to recover my data and trying numerous other tricks in quotes
 recommended by online chats etc i was fortunate to come across spin right at first the glowing
 testimonials he seemed i he said at first the glowing testimonials seemed just too good to be true
 and i will admit that i thought they may have even been fake so i invested the eighty nine dollars
 downloaded the file and fired up the floppy at first i thought that it was going nowhere
 because after four hours it still said two percent complete i figured i would leave it running over
 the weekend and imagine my surprise when i came in this morning saw the message that it had completed
 remove the floppy and it booted up wow check disc and then started windows xp all i can say is
 wow wow that's what i say wow he finished says thank you for taking the time to create this program
 that runs off a low floppy yet salvaged my eighty gig drive it's bad enough losing data
 but i also saved the hours it would have taken to recreate my desktop links etc needless to say
 i'm impressed cool Steve you've done it again love love getting those notes grc.com spin right
 everybody's favorite my favorite disc maintenance and recovery utility s p i n r i t e dot info for
 more testimonials course when you get testimonials they're not made up not made up made up you do also
 get the at grc.com the the 16 kilobyte version of the show that the transcription that Elaine does
 and lots of show notes grc.com that steves site and the home of security now Steve we've had a
 great time i will be back from the cruise next week we could talk more about security on thursday
 what do you say i think that's a great idea it would have never missed a week and as far as i
 if there's anything i had to say about it we are never going i love that you know you know i appreciate
 that in the show host thanks Steve we'll see you next time
