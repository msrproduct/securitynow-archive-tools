## PROJECT COST TRACKING

### Billing Rate for Internal Accounting

**Recommended Hourly Rates (2026 Market Data):**
- **Pure Coding/Debugging:** $50/hr (market rate for specialized PowerShell + AI work)
- **Learning/Research:** $30/hr (junior learning rate)
- **Blended Average:** $40-45/hr (conservative, 20-30% below market)

**Why $40-50/hr is Defensible:**
- Self-taught developers average $45/hr (2026 US market data)
- Specialized niche: Security Now archiving + AI transcription + multi-repo Git
- Production-ready tool with real user base potential
- No supervision required - self-directed architecture decisions

**Market Rate Comparisons (2026):**
- **External PowerShell Developer:** $55-65/hr (freelance market)
- **AI/ML Integration Specialist:** $60-75/hr (market rate)
- **DevOps/Git Automation:** $50-60/hr (market rate)
- **Technical Writing/Documentation:** $40-50/hr (market rate)

**Blended Rate Justification:**
- This project combines all four specialties
- Self-directed work (no project management overhead)
- Production-ready deliverables (not learning exercises)
- **Conservative estimate: $40-50/hr is 20-30% BELOW market**

### Time Tracking System

**Implementation (Optional):**
```powershell
# Start tracking session
.\scripts\Start-DevSession.ps1 -Task "v3.2.0 performance optimization"

# Work on code...

# End session and log time
.\scripts\End-DevSession.ps1 -Rate 45  # Outputs to project-time-log.csv
```

**CSV Output Format:**
```csv
Date,Task,Hours,Rate,Cost,Notes
2026-01-16,Engine v3.1.2 fix,3.5,50,175,Coding
2026-01-16,Learning wkhtmltopdf,1.2,30,36,Research
2026-01-16,MCP workflow setup,1.0,50,50,Process automation
```

### Sweat Equity Tracking

**Use Cases:**
1. **Payback Calculation** - Track sweat equity for future revenue split
2. **Investor Pitch** - Demonstrate project value with real development costs
3. **ROI Analysis** - Compare DIY cost vs. hiring external developer
4. **Tax Deduction** - Document time investment for business expense tracking

**Example ROI Calculation:**
```
Project Hours: 120 hours (estimated full v3.x development)
Blended Rate: $45/hr
Sweat Equity Value: $5,400

External Developer Cost: $60/hr × 120 hrs = $7,200
Savings: $1,800 (25% cost reduction)

Future Revenue Potential: $10,000+ (if monetized)
ROI: 85% ($5,400 investment → $10,000 return)
```

### Time Tracking Best Practices

**What to Track:**
- ✅ Active coding/debugging sessions
- ✅ Architecture/design decisions
- ✅ Documentation writing
- ✅ Testing and validation
- ✅ Research (if directly applicable)

**What NOT to Track:**
- ❌ Casual learning (unrelated to project)
- ❌ Reddit/forum browsing
- ❌ Chatting about project (not active work)
- ❌ Procrastination time

**Honesty Policy:**
- Track ONLY productive work time
- Round DOWN to nearest 15 minutes
- Deduct break time from sessions
- Use lower rate ($30/hr) for exploratory learning

### Current Project Investment (Estimated)

**As of 2026-01-16:**

| Phase | Hours | Rate | Cost | Notes |
|-------|-------|------|------|-------|
| Initial Setup (v1.0-v2.0) | 15 | $30 | $450 | Learning Whisper, wkhtmltopdf |
| Core Engine (v3.0-v3.1) | 25 | $50 | $1,250 | Production script development |
| Bug Fixes (v3.1.1-v3.1.2) | 8 | $50 | $400 | TEXT WALL fix, DryRun UX |
| Documentation | 12 | $40 | $480 | ai-context.md, COMMON-MISTAKES.md |
| MCP Workflow (v3.7-v3.8) | 3 | $50 | $150 | Process automation |
| **TOTAL** | **63** | **$44 avg** | **$2,730** | **~$2,700 sweat equity** |

**Notes:**
- Hours are CONSERVATIVE (likely underestimated)
- Excludes time spent in past failed approaches
- Blended rate ($44/hr) is 27% below market ($60/hr)
- **Actual value if hiring external developer: ~$3,800**

### Future Monetization Scenarios

**Option 1: Freemium Model**
- Free: Public repo, basic scripts

- Target: 100 customers × $50 = $5,000 revenue
- ROI: 83% ($2,730 investment → $5,000 return)

**Option 2: Consulting/Custom Builds**
- Offer custom archive builds for enterprises
- Charge: $500-1,000 per custom build
- Target: 5 customers = $2,500-5,000 revenue
- ROI: 83% (break-even after 6 customers)

**Option 3: Patreon/Sponsorship**
- Monthly support from Security Now fans
- Target: 50 patrons × $5/mo = $250/mo = $3,000/year
- ROI: 110% (break-even in 11 months)

**Option 4: Educational Content**
- Course: "Building Archive Tools with PowerShell + AI"
- Charge: $99 per student
- Target: 30 students = $2,970 revenue
- ROI: 109% (break-even + market validation)

### Privacy & Business Strategy Notes

**Why This Section Stays Private:**
1. **Competitive Advantage** - Don't reveal monetization strategy to potential competitors
2. **Negotiating Position** - Avoid anchoring pricing discussions with public rate disclosure
3. **Personal Privacy** - Billing rates are personal financial information
4. **Professional Image** - Public focus should be on tool quality, not profit motive

**Public Messaging Strategy:**
- Emphasize: "Free tools for Security Now fans" (Steve Gibson alignment)
- De-emphasize: Monetization plans, cost tracking
- Focus: Open-source contribution, community value
- Reserve: Premium features for future (don't overpromise)
