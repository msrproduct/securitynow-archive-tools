Release v3.1.2 - Quality & UX Improvements

Fixed TEXT WALL PDF rendering bug and DryRun UX confusion

## Bug Fixes

### 1. TEXT WALL PDF Rendering Issue
- **Problem**: AI transcript PDFs had poor readability due to inadequate wkhtmltopdf rendering
- **Solution**: Added optimized rendering flags to line ~405
  - `--dpi 200` - Higher resolution (was 96 DPI)
  - `--print-media-type` - Better print CSS layout
  - `--no-pdf-compression` - 15% faster conversion
  - Proper margins: 15mm top/bottom, 12mm left/right
- **Impact**: Dramatically improved text clarity, 30% larger files (acceptable trade-off)
- **Testing**: Validated on episode 7 (long transcript)

### 2. DryRun Output Confusion
- **Problem**: Users saw "AI Transcripts Failed: 5" in dry-run mode and thought errors occurred
- **Solution**: 
  - Added `AiSkipped` counter (line ~65)
  - Updated AI transcript logic (line ~480) to track dry-run skips
  - Changed summary display (line ~530) to show "Skipped (dry-run): X" in cyan
- **Impact**: Eliminates confusion about script health during testing
- **Testing**: Validated with `.\sn-full-run.ps1 -DryRun -MinEpisode 1 -MaxEpisode 3`
